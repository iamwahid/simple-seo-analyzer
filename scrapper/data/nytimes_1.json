        "content": "HOUSTON \u2014 After months of pleading for more gun control measures, a Democrat who represents Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children died in a mass shooting, was told by the Republican leader of the State Senate to stop bringing up gun legislation or be barred from speaking at all.In the State House, Republican members talked and joked among themselves as another Democrat, Representative Jarvis Johnson of Houston, rose to discuss gun control. \u201cThis is not a joke \u2014 this is real,\u201d he shouted from the lectern at his colleagues on Friday. \u201cChildren every day are dying.\u201dIt was only hours later that gunfire again ripped apart the daily life of people in Texas. This time the violence erupted at a popular shopping center in the Dallas suburb of Allen, where a 33-year-old gunman armed with what officials said was an AR-15-style rifle swiftly killed eight people and wounded at least seven others, including at least one child, before a police officer fatally shot him on Saturday.VideoShoppers evacuated an outlet mall in Allen, Texas, where a gunman killed eight people before being fatally shot by a police officer.CreditCredit...LM Otero/Associated PressThe killings came just over a week after a mass shooting in rural San Jacinto County, north of Houston, where five people living together were killed by a neighbor after they asked him to stop shooting his gun in his front yard. And they occurred a little less than a year after the massacre at Uvalde, where two teachers also died.Among some Texans, the drumbeat of mass murder has fueled rising frustration and a slight openness to more gun regulation in a state where even Democrats proudly discuss their firearms. But the violence has done little to reshape the political realities in the State Capitol, where Republicans control both legislative chambers and all statewide offices.In the past two years, as the state has been shaken by more than a dozen mass killings of four or more people, Texas has increased access to firearms, doing away with its permit requirements to carry handguns and lowering the age when adults can carry handguns to 18 from 21.On Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, attended a vigil for the victims of the shooting at the shopping center, Allen Premium Outlets, but said earlier that there would be no new effort by his administration to limit access to firearms \u2014 because it would not work.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increased number of shootings in states with easy gun laws as well as shootings in states with very strict gun laws,\u201d Mr. Abbott said in an interview on Fox News. He said Texas was responding to the \u201cdramatic increase in the amount of anger\u201d across the United States by going to \u201cits root cause, which is addressing the mental health problems behind it.\u201dImageAna Rodriguez, whose daughter, Maite Rodriguez, 10, was killed in the school shooting in Uvalde, and members of her family leaving the Texas State Capitol in Austin after taking part in a rally in August.Credit...Tamir Kalifa for The New York TimesImageFamily members of children killed in the shooting in Uvalde, Texas, marched from the Capitol to the governor\u2019s mansion to encourage Texans to vote, and to call for raising the minimum age to buy an assault rifle to 21 from 18.Credit...Tamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe message was largely the same as one delivered by the governor the day after the elementary school shooting in Uvalde in May 2022, when he observed during a news conference that more people are shot in Chicago each weekend than in Texas schools.By contrast, President Biden urged action on Sunday. \u201cRepublican members of Congress cannot continue to meet this epidemic with a shrug,\u201d he said in a statement that called for \u201ca bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\u201dIn Texas, a bill to raise the age to purchase an AR-15-style rifle to 21 from 18 has been introduced by Democrats and championed by the relatives of the children killed in Uvalde, but it was not likely to pass out of committee before a legislative deadline on Monday. That legislation would have prevented the 18-year-old gunman in Uvalde from purchasing the weapon he used, but it would not have been a factor in the shooting in Allen, where the gunman was older.Investigators on Sunday were still working to determine what had motivated that gunman to open fire at the shopping center, about 25 miles north of Dallas. It was the second-deadliest shooting of the year in the United States, after the Monterey Park, Calif., massacre in which a gunman killed 11 people in a ballroom on Jan. 21.The Texas Department of Public Safety identified the gunman in Saturday\u2019s attack as Mauricio Garcia, 33, of Dallas.A video circulating on social media appeared to show him lying on the ground, clad in black and equipped with what appeared to be a tactical vest, multiple rounds of ammunition and a long gun.The gunman may have espoused white supremacist ideology, according to two law enforcement officials, but it was not yet known whether the shooting was an act of domestic terrorism.He arrived at the large outdoor mall in the midafternoon on Saturday, stepped from a silver sedan and at around 3:30 p.m. began firing a rifle at shoppers walking outside.According to video taken at the scene, the gunfire sent people running for safety. A police officer who had been on an unrelated assignment at the mall heard gunfire, rushed toward it and fatally shot the gunman, Chief Brian E. Harvey of the Allen Police Department said on Saturday.Officers and agents from multiple law enforcement agencies including the local police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Public Safety were still working on Sunday to identify the victims and notify their families. The injured \u2014 who ranged in age from 5 to 61 \u2014 were being treated at three trauma centers, according to a spokesman for one of the centers, Medical City Healthcare.ImageTexas state troopers blocked the entrance to Allen Premium Outlets on Sunday.Credit...Cooper Neill for The New York TimesImageLenna Maleki painted a cross at a memorial outside Allen Premium Outlets.Credit...Cooper Neill for The New York TimesNo update on the investigation was provided on Sunday, but gun control proponents in the state were deploring the report of yet another episode of large-scale violence.\u201cThis is no longer unimaginable,\u201d Representative Johnson said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cWe are almost to the point of normalizing mass shootings in Texas, and that is the most disturbing thing.\u201dWhile less supportive of stricter gun regulation than Americans as a whole, Texans support some limited gun control measures, polls have shown, and over the past few years views on guns among Republican voters in Texas have appeared to moderate somewhat, according to polls by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2020, 67 percent of Republicans told pollsters that more guns made the United States safer. The next year, that percentage declined, and, after the Uvalde shooting, it declined again, to 57 percent.\u201cYou are seeing a very slow erosion in some of the underlying attitudes that suggest a blanket enthusiasm for guns among Republicans,\u201d James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project, said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not dropping enough to signal a change, at least not yet.\u201dState Senator Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat who represents Uvalde, said that after the elementary school massacre two of his Republican colleagues privately voiced support to him for some kind of gun control measures. \u201cBut since then, nothing has changed,\u201d he said in an interview on Sunday.For months, Mr. Gutierrez has been trying to force action in the State Senate, a body dominated by its Republican leader, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who warned Mr. Gutierrez last month against discussing gun control during a debate on an unrelated bill to ban minors from drag shows.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to eliminate these guns, I get it \u2014 and I own guns myself,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. But there are steps that can be taken, he said, such as expanding background checks or raising the age to buy an AR-15-style rifle. \u201cThis is simple stuff,\u201d he said.In Allen on Sunday, Amy Bennett stood on the side of a road near Cottonwood Creek Church, where the vigil for the shooting victims was being held. She held a sign that said \u201cThis voter opposes gun violence,\u201d with a picture of an AR-15 crossed out. \u201cThoughts and prayers are useless,\u201d said another sign pinned to her shirt. \u201cThe dead are still dead.\u201dSeveral cars honked as they passed by.ImageState Senator Roland Gutierrez of Texas, whose district includes Uvalde, speaking in February at a news conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin.Credit...Tamir Kalifa for The New York TimesFor some Texans, like Annalisha Tiller, 48, a Republican who lives in the neighborhood of San Jacinto County where last month\u2019s mass shooting took place, the ease with which anyone can get a gun has made her feel unsafe and open to restrictions such as requiring background checks for weapons purchased at gun shows.\u201cAccess to guns is too easy here,\u201d she said. At the same time, she arms herself whenever she goes out, for safety. \u201cWe don\u2019t have police out here to protect us,\u201d she said. \u201cI want good people with guns.\u201dMamie Lester, 59, a steadfast Republican who lives on a 50-acre farm in North Texas, said she and her husband had more than a dozen guns \u2014 rifles, shotguns and pistols \u2014 that remain carefully locked up in their home when not in use. But the killings in Allen, coming after other recent mass shootings, has deepened her feeling that something has to be done.\u201cI do realize that this is all out of control,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not totally against gun control, but they\u2019re trying to control it for the wrong people. You\u2019ve got to keep the guns out the hands of the criminals.\u201d She said better background checks could be an answer.Gregory K. Taggart, a firearms trainer at Texas Legends, a gun range in Allen near where the latest shooting occurred, echoed Governor Abbott when he said that mental health needed to be considered in any analysis of recent gun violence. \u201cGuns have been around forever. Mass shootings have not been,\u201d Mr. Taggart said. \u201cMy first question would be, Why do we have mass shootings now? I think our society is breaking down.\u201dRestricting guns is not the answer, he added. \u201cWhen people talk about drunk driving, do they say, Let\u2019s ban cars?\u201dPart of the reason Republicans in Texas may not feel political pressure on the issue is the state\u2019s recent electoral history. The Uvalde shooting took place during a hard-fought governor\u2019s race between Mr. Abbott, running for a third term, and Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former Democratic congressman who campaigned for some of the same gun control proposals that have recently been before the legislature. Mr. Abbott won by a wide margin.Last month, relatives of victims in Uvalde traveled to the State Capitol to testify on behalf of the bill to raise the age for buying an AR-15-style rifle. The fact that a committee in the Republican-controlled House even agreed to listen to them had felt to them like a kind of victory.Then they waited for hours for their turn to speak. They were finally called in after 10 p.m., about 13 hours after they arrived at the Capitol that morning.\u201cI\u2019m reminded of May 24, 2022, when we waited hours to be told our daughter would never come home,\u201d Kimberly Rubio told the committee through tears, speaking of her daughter Lexie, who was killed in the shooting. \u201cI expressed confusion then, and I\u2019m perplexed now. Did you think we would go home?\u201dMary Beth Gahan, Remy Tumin, Claire Fahy and Lauren McCarthy contributed reporting.",

A spokesman for Medical City Healthcare, which was treating victims at its three trauma facilities, said the injured ranged in age from 5 to 61.The victims have not been publicly identified.In a statement on Sunday, President Biden said an unspecified number of children were among those killed.What did witnesses see?ImageShoppers being evacuated from the mall on Saturday.Credit...WFAA, via Associated PressGeoffrey Keaton was having lunch with his 16-year-old daughter at Fatburger in the mall when they heard gunshots.\u201cI got my baby girl under the counter to shield her, and then they got louder, like he was right there,\u201d Mr. Keaton said.Mr. Keaton said the restaurant\u2019s manager had allowed customers to hide in the back, where they then exited through a rear door and ran to their cars.A livestream from a local Fox television affiliate showed scores of shoppers being evacuated in an orderly fashion from shops.\u201cIt was just kind of chaotic for a second,\u201d said Kaleo Palakiko, 36. \u201cThen when someone said, \u2018Shooter,\u2019 we all ran to the back of the store.\u201dMr. Palakiko and his parents hid in a storeroom for about 45 minutes before they were released by the police and walked out with their hands in the air.How does this shooting compare with others this year?Saturday\u2019s attack is the second-deadliest shooting of the year, after the Monterey Park, Calif., massacre on Jan. 21, in which a gunman killed 11 people in a ballroom.According to the Gun Violence Archive, a database of shootings in the United States, there have been 199 \u201cmass shootings,\u201d which the archive defines as the shooting of at least four people, in 2023.Last weekend, a gunman killed five people in Cleveland, Texas, near Houston, after he was asked by neighbors to stop shooting in his yard. He was captured after a multiday manhunt.On Monday, a registered sex offender fatally shot six people, including his wife and three of her children, near Tulsa, Okla., before turning the gun on himself.On Wednesday, a gunman opened fire at a medical office building in Atlanta, killing one person and injuring four others. That, too, led to a manhunt before the suspect was caught.",

        "author": "Benjamin Mullin",
        "content": "Pat Holloway has seen her share of destruction during a 30-year career as a photojournalist: the 1993 standoff in Waco, Texas; the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh; and the 2011 tornado that struck Joplin, Mo.But this weekend, she said in an interview, she had had enough. When graphic images began circulating on Twitter showing bloody victims of a mass shooting at a mall in Texas that left at least nine people, including the gunman, dead, she tweeted at Elon Musk, Twitter\u2019s owner, demanding that he do something.\u201cThis family does not deserve to see the dead relatives spread across Twitter for everybody to see,\u201d Ms. Holloway, 64, said in the interview on Sunday.Ms. Holloway was one of many Twitter users who criticized the social network for allowing the grisly images \u2014 including of a blood-spattered child \u2014 to spread virally across the platform after the shooting on Saturday. Though gruesome images have become common on social media, where a cellphone camera and an internet connection make everyone a publisher, the unusually graphic nature of the images drew sustained outcry from users. And they threw a harsh spotlight on Twitter\u2019s content moderation practices, which have been curtailed since Mr. Musk acquired the company last year.Like other social media companies, Twitter has once again found itself in a position akin to that of traditional newspaper editors, who wrestle with difficult decisions about how much to show their audiences. Though newspapers and magazines generally spare their readers from truly graphic images, they have made some exceptions, as Jet magazine did in 1955 when it published open-casket images of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy who was beaten to death in Mississippi, to illustrate the horrors of the Jim Crow-era South.Unlike newspaper and magazine publishers, however, tech companies like Twitter must enforce their decisions on a huge scale, policing millions of users with a combination of automated systems and human content moderators.Other tech companies like Facebook\u2019s parent, Meta, and YouTube\u2019s parent, Alphabet, have invested in large teams that reduce the spread of violent images on their platforms. Twitter, on the other hand, has scaled back its content moderation since Mr. Musk bought the site late last October, laying off full-time employees and contractors on the trust and safety teams that manage content moderation. Mr. Musk, who has described himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist,\u201d said last November that he would establish a \u201ccontent moderation council\u201d that would decide which posts should stay up and which should be taken down. He later reneged on that promise.Twitter, Alphabet and Meta did not respond to requests for comment.Graphic content was never completely banned by Twitter, even before Mr. Musk took over. The platform, for instance, has allowed images of people killed or wounded in the war in Ukraine, arguing that they are newsworthy and informative. The company sometimes places warning labels or pop-ups on sensitive content, requiring that users opt in to see the imagery.While many users clearly spread the images of the massacre, including of the dead attacker, for shock value, others retweeted them to underscore the horrors of gun violence. \u201cThe N.R.A.\u2019s America,\u201d one tweet read. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going away,\u201d said another. The New York Times is not linking to the social media posts containing the graphic images.Claire Wardle, the co-founder of the Information Futures Lab at Brown University, said in an interview that tech companies must balance their desire to protect their users with the responsibility to preserve newsworthy or otherwise important images \u2014 even those that are uncomfortable to look at. She cited as precedent the decision to publish a Vietnam War image of Kim Phuc Phan Thi, who became known as \u201cNapalm Girl\u201d after a photo of her suffering following a napalm strike circulated around the world.She added that she favored graphic images of noteworthy events remaining online, with some kind of overlay that requires users to choose to see the content.\u201cThis is news,\u201d she said. \u201cOften, we see this kind of imagery in other countries and nobody bats an eyelid. But then it happens to Americans and people say, \u2018Should we be seeing this?\u2019\u201dFor years, social media companies have had to grapple with the proliferation of bloody images and videos following terrible violence. Last year, Facebook was criticized for circulating ads next to a graphic video of a racist shooting rampage in Buffalo, N.Y., that was live-streamed on the video platform Twitch. The Buffalo gunman claimed to have drawn inspiration from a 2019 mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, that left at least 50 people dead and was broadcast live on Facebook. For years, Twitter has taken down versions of the Christchurch video, arguing that the footage glorifies the violent messages the gunman espoused.Though the graphic images of the Texas mall shooting circulated widely on Twitter, they seemed to be less prominent on other online platforms on Sunday. Keyword searches for the Allen, Texas, shooting on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube yielded mostly news reports and less explicit eyewitness videos.Sarah T. Roberts, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who studies content moderation, drew a distinction between editors at traditional media companies and social media platforms, which are not bound by the ethics that traditional journalists adhere to \u2014 including minimizing harm to the viewer and the friends and family of the people who were killed.\u201cI understand where people on social media are coming from who want to circulate these images in the hopes that it will make a change,\u201d Ms. Roberts said. \u201cBut unfortunately, social media as a business is not set up to support that. What it\u2019s set up to do is to profit from the circulation of these images.\u201dRyan Mac contributed reporting.",

        "author": "Ben Protess,, Kate Christobek,, Jonah E. Bromwich,, William K. Rashbaum, Sean Piccoli",
        "content": "A lawyer was accused of stealing $1.2 million from his law firm and covering it up. An insurance broker was accused of taking $350,000 from a client and covering it up. And a former president was accused of orchestrating a $130,000 hush-money payment to a porn star and covering it up.All three men were prosecuted by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, and each faced the same felony charge: falsifying business records.The charge, a staple of his office\u2019s white-collar work, can only be elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony if the defendant falsified the records in an attempt to commit or conceal a second crime.Although the district attorney\u2019s office is not required to identify the second crime at the outset of the case, Mr. Bragg prosecuted both the lawyer and the insurance broker for additional crimes \u2014 including grand larceny \u2014 telegraphing why their false records charges were bumped up to felonies. Only the former president, Donald J. Trump, was indicted for falsifying business records, and no other crimes.A New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor \u2014 based on court records, interviews and information the office provided \u2014 shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge. The decision to charge Mr. Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records \u2014 and no other crimes \u2014 highlights the unique nature of the case, the first indictment of a former American president. Mr. Bragg, a Democrat, has drawn criticism from Mr. Trump\u2019s allies, who say that he bumped up the charges to a felony for political reasons.But Mr. Bragg has argued that if the Trump indictment is unusual, it is only because the facts of this case are unusual as well, and the charge must fit the facts: Mr. Trump is accused of covering up a payoff to a porn star to bury a sex scandal in the days before a presidential election.Mr. Bragg also said, at a news conference on the day of Mr. Trump\u2019s arraignment, that an option for the second crime could be a federal election law violation, under the theory that the hush money illegally aided Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.And on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers sought to move the case from New York State Supreme Court to federal court, citing those comments as part of the justification for the legal change of scenery. The former president\u2019s lawyers may in part be using the request to move the case as a way to gain more clarity on the second crime.Mr. Bragg\u2019s supporters, including former prosecutors with the district attorney\u2019s office, have defended his decision not to explicitly mention the second crime in the indictment. They noted that even in the many cases where other crimes are charged, the district attorney\u2019s office never specifies upfront which crime is being used to elevate the false records charge to a felony. In that sense, the Trump case is typical.\u201cThe indictment doesn\u2019t specify it because the law does not so require,\u201d Mr. Bragg said, in his usual lawyerly fashion, at his news conference.ImageMr. Trump and his allies have accused Mr. Bragg of basing his charging decision on politics, not the law.Credit...Sophie Park for The New York TimesThe somewhat unusual nature of the Trump indictment in some ways encapsulated both Mr. Bragg\u2019s skills and shortcomings as district attorney. A career prosecutor, Mr. Bragg has a keen eye for legal strategy but something of a blind spot for the way his decisions are perceived by the public.His maneuvering on the second crime could provide his prosecutors a strategic advantage in the courtroom, as he keeps Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers guessing about what it will be. If Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers convince the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, that an election law violation is not viable, Mr. Bragg can pivot to another, like a quarterback calling an audible.\u201cYou\u2019re not in the defendant\u2019s head, so you have to be careful locking yourself into any one thing,\u201d said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, one of the leaders of the office under Mr. Bragg\u2019s predecessor. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have to, why do that?\u201dFor now, though, that means it is unclear how exactly prosecutors plan to argue that Mr. Trump is guilty of 34 felonies, rather than 34 misdemeanors.\u201cMy view is that while the law allows the prosecutor to play it close to the vest, it seems that best practice and fairness requires they reveal \u2014 to the extent they know \u2014 what the crimes are,\u201d said Marc F. Scholl, who served in the district attorney\u2019s office for nearly four decades in both trial and senior investigative roles. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s a matter of such public interest,\u201d he added of the Trump case, \u201cyou really want to show the world you\u2019re not hiding anything.\u201dTo Mr. Bragg, a former federal public corruption prosecutor, the Trump case is the simple story of a criminal cover-up.The case centers on the $130,000 hush-money payment to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, who was threatening to go public with her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s fixer at the time, Michael D. Cohen, paid Ms. Daniels to buy her silence in the final days of the 2016 campaign. Mr. Cohen, who has since turned against Mr. Trump and become Mr. Bragg\u2019s star witness, has said he was acting on Mr. Trump\u2019s orders.Mr. Bragg\u2019s prosecutors say that Mr. Trump subsequently covered up his reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. The president\u2019s company recorded the repayment to Mr. Cohen as \u201clegal expenses\u201d and cited a retainer agreement \u2014 even though there were no such legal expenses, and no such retainer agreement.Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance violations one of which stemmed from the hush-money payment to Ms. Daniels. That federal crime is one of the options Mr. Bragg\u2019s prosecutors are mulling for the bump-up crime in the case against the former president.ImageMichael D. Cohen, right, and his lawyer, Lanny Davis, met repeatedly with prosecutors as they investigated Mr. Trump.Credit...Jefferson Siegel for The New York TimesBut nearly every other defendant indicted by Mr. Bragg\u2019s office for falsifying business records was charged in state court with another crime.Aside from Mr. Trump, The Times could identify only two other defendants in the last decade or so to be indicted solely for felony falsifying records. Under Mr. Bragg\u2019s predecessor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a woman was charged for a relatively minor offense: providing a fake social security number to a bank.And last year, under Mr. Bragg, a man was charged with two felony counts of falsifying business records. But unlike Mr. Trump, that man had two co-defendants on the same indictment charged with grand larceny, which was the second crime prosecutors used to elevate his charges to a felony.The only other cases in which Mr. Vance or Mr. Bragg brought falsifying records charges \u2014 and no other crimes \u2014 came when the defendants struck a plea deal before an indictment, a stark contrast from Mr. Trump who has already been indicted and is expected to fight the charges tooth and nail.The rarity of a stand-alone falsifying business records case stems partly from the low-level nature of the charge. Falsifying business records is an E-felony, the lowest level in New York, so the district attorney\u2019s office often tacks it on in addition to other more serious crimes. And financial fraud investigations typically uncover evidence of multiple economic crimes, giving prosecutors a bevy of options.Under Mr. Bragg, prosecutors have filed more than 120 counts of falsifying business records against a wide variety of individuals and companies, and in all of those cases, prosecutors charged the crime as a felony, according to the district attorney\u2019s office.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are expected to demand that prosecutors identify the second crime before trial, but Mr. Bragg may never need to fully reveal his plan. He could argue to the judge that felony false records cases are governed by a 43-year-old New York Court of Appeals case involving a burglary charge, which also requires the intent to commit another crime. In that case, the court held that prosecutors need not reveal a second crime.If Mr. Bragg\u2019s argument persuades Justice Merchan, Mr. Trump will almost certainly appeal, highlighting the obvious distinctions between a false records case and burglary. The resulting litigation could take years to resolve as his appeal is examined in today\u2019s legal environment, which demands greater transparency from prosecutors than was common 43 years ago.While the Trump indictment does not reference a second crime, Mr. Bragg suggested three possible options during his news conference: Two versions of an election crime \u2014 one state, one federal \u2014 as well as tax fraud.The election law crimes might put Mr. Bragg on uncharted ground, raising the possibility that the courts could throw out or limit the case.Never before has a New York State prosecutor brought an election law case involving a federal campaign, The Times analysis strongly suggests. An untested case against any defendant, let alone a former president of the United States, raises the risk for Mr. Bragg legally \u2014 and could expose him to political blowback.\u201cThe notion that a politician making efforts to hide unflattering information from the American voter constitutes a criminal offense sounds a lot to me like criminalizing politics,\u201d said Thomas Kenniff, a defense lawyer in Manhattan and Mr. Bragg\u2019s Republican opponent in the 2021 race for district attorney.If Mr. Bragg cites federal election law, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers will likely argue that a state prosecutor has no authority to invoke a federal crime. And if he uses a state election law, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue that federal campaign finance law explicitly says that it overrides \u2014 pre-empts, in legal terminology \u2014 state election law when it comes to campaign donation limits.Yet Mr. Bragg may have found an exception. At his news conference, Mr. Bragg cited a state election law that bars any conspiracy to promote \u201cthe election of any person to a public office by unlawful means\u201d \u2014 not specifically related to donation limits.And even if a judge were to reject all election-related second crimes, then Mr. Bragg still has tax fraud to fall back on. Under that theory, his prosecutors could argue that the second crime was an intent \u2014 by the Trump Organization and possibly Mr. Cohen \u2014 to hide the true purpose of the reimbursement on their state tax returns.Even though there was no effort to cheat on the taxes, any attempt to misrepresent the purpose of the hush money on tax documents could be considered a tax crime, experts said.\u201cWhat it really is to my observation is misusing the federal and presumably state tax system to characterize a transaction falsely,\u201d said Scott D. Michel, a partner at Caplin and Drysdale. Discussing the prosecution\u2019s apparent theory, he said, \u201cYou cannot have a tax system where people can abuse the filing process and abuse the reporting process to further criminal conduct.\u201d",

        "title": "Wagner Chief Appears to Backtrack on Threat to Pull Fighters From Bakhmut",
        "author": "Neil MacFarquhar,, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Andr\u00e9s R. Mart\u00ednez",
        "content": "The head of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group said on Sunday that he had been promised as much ammunition and weaponry as needed to continue the fight for the embattled Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, two days after he threatened to withdraw his fighters because Moscow\u2019s Ministry of Defense was failing to support them.\u201cWe have been promised as much ammunition and armament as we need to keep going,\u201d the Wagner group\u2019s founder, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, said in an audio statement released Sunday on his channel on the Telegram messaging app. There was no immediate comment from Russia\u2019s defense ministry.On Friday, Mr. Prigozhin launched what was widely considered an effort at brinkmanship, by threatening to withdraw all of his fighters from Bakhmut, accusing Russia\u2019s military bureaucracy of starving him of the ammunition needed to fully capture the city. He had appeared in a gruesome video standing in front of row after row of what he said were freshly killed fighters, saying the ministry had caused \u201cuseless and unjustified\u201d losses by failing to replenish the ammunition stocks.While Mr. Prigozhin had complained about ammunition shortages and threatened to pull out of the city before, he had not previously given a date. This time, he named Wednesday \u2014 the day after Russia\u2019s Victory Day holiday \u2014 as the deadline for his forces to withdraw and \u201click their wounds.\u201d The May 9 holiday celebrates the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany and has taken on particular resonance in Russia amid its war in Ukraine.Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, wrote on Telegram on Sunday that he had visited troops in the area of Bakhmut, where he previously said Russia was employing \u201cscorched-earth tactics.\u201d The shelling has intensified, he said, as Russia attempts to seize the city by Tuesday.\u201cOur task is to prevent this,\u201d he wrote.Few military analysts expected Mr. Prigozhin to carry out his threat, especially because Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense has no real alternative to the estimated 10,000 Wagner fighters fighting for control of the devastated city, where 70,000 people lived before the invasion.ImageA damaged building in the vicinity of Bakhmut last month. Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesA sliver of Bakhmut remains in Ukrainian hands, with the Russian Ministry of Defense claiming on Sunday that its forces had made further small advances. All the territory Russia has gained during months of grinding conflict in the city has also come at an enormous cost for both sides, including the deaths of thousands of fighters recruited by Wagner from Russian prisons and thrown right onto the battlefield. Mr. Prigozhin also said that Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the commander of the air force nicknamed \u201cGeneral Armageddon,\u201d had been appointed as his liaison with the military.If confirmed, the appointment of Gen. Surovikin, who developed a close relationship with Wagner while commanding the Russian forces in Syria, could help address the deep-seated tension between the Wagner mercenary forces and the regular Russian Army, which has repeatedly interrupted Russian efforts to push forward in Ukraine.Gen. Surovikin was appointed overall commander of the Russian forces in Ukraine last October, which was considered a sign that Mr. Prigozhin was gaining influence in the Kremlin. But he was then replaced three months later by Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of staff of the Russian military.Mr. Prigozhin openly cursed Gen. Gerasimov and Sergei Shoigu, Russia\u2019s minister of defense, in his expletive-laden video on Friday. Some analysts have attributed the tensions to rivalries for President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s favor.It is unclear whether the ammunition promised to Mr. Prigozhin can be deployed fast enough to change the battle for the city that started last August. In threatening to withdraw, Mr. Prigozhin stressed just how weary his men were of the fight.ImageA Ukrainian soldier driving through western Bakhmut last month.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesBut the chances of that seem remote. Ukraine is expected to soon begin a counteroffensive powered by fresh supplies of advanced Western military equipment, including tanks and armored personnel carriers that have already arrived in the country.Here\u2019s what else is happening in Ukraine:Drones targeted Crimea, Russia saysThe Kremlin-installed authorities in Crimea said on Sunday that Ukraine had launched a wave of drones on the occupied peninsula overnight, the latest in a string of reported attacks on Russian-held territory ahead of an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive.Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-appointed governor of the port of Sevastopol, the largest city in Crimea and home to the Russian Navy\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, said that \u201cmore than 10\u201d drones were involved in the attack. At least three were destroyed or crashed, he said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that there were no reports of damage.Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that a total of 22 Ukrainian drones had been detected over the Black Sea overnight. All of the drones were shot down or disabled, it said in a statement.The claims could not be independently verified, and Ukrainian officials had not commented.Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, has been a key conduit for supplies and troops supporting Russia\u2019s occupying forces in southern Ukraine. Attacks and explosions there have picked up in recent months, which military analysts say could help set the stage for a long-anticipated counteroffensive that Ukrainian officials have said is in the final stages of preparation.In just the past two weeks, refineries and military installations on the peninsula have been targeted. The Russian authorities have sought to downplay the attacks, but Ukraine\u2019s military has said that at least one of the attacks was in preparation for its counteroffensive.ImageSmoke rising after a drone attack, in Sevastopol, Crimea, last month.Credit...ReutersA deadly attack in KhersonNine Ukrainian mine disposal experts were killed when they came under fire from Russian forces while they were working in the southern Kherson region, Ukrainian officials said.President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Sunday that the victims had been killed on Saturday while they were \u201crestoring safety for people.\u201dThe chief of the State Emergency Service, Serhiy Kruk, said in a post on Facebook on Saturday that the demining team had been fired on while working. Ukrainian demining experts have regularly been killed and wounded while attempting to clear mines, often laid by retreating Russian forces, but it is unusual for them to be targeted by enemy fire. It was not clear where in the region the incident took place.Experts had removed 7,300 mines in the last week, the service said in a post on the Telegram social messaging app.Russian writer in stable condition after car bombingZakhar Prilepin, a famous Russian novelist and nationalist ideologue, said on Sunday that both his legs were broken when his Audi S.U.V. blew up a day earlier in an apparent assassination attempt near the city of Nizhny Novgorod.Mr. Prilepin, an outspoken supporter of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and volunteer fighter there sporadically since 2014, wrote on Telegram that he was driving the S.U.V. at the time of the explosion, which killed his friend and passenger. Russian state media previously reported that Mr. Prilepin was a passenger.The bombing was the third such attack on a high profile hawk since last August; the other two were killed.Mr. Prilepin wrote that the explosion was caused by a mine that detonated shortly after he\u2019d dropped off his daughter. A second mine did not detonate, he added.Russian law enforcement officials said a suspect with links to the Ukrainian special services had confessed to the bombing. Ukrainian officials denied any involvement.Mr. Prilepin had been put on a Ukrainian wanted list for acting as both an administrator and a battalion commander for the separatist forces in the east, but Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president, said in an televised interview that Mr. Prilepin had no influence on the course of the war.\u201cUkraine does not resort to such excesses,\u201d he told the Ukrainian channel Freedom TV.A Russian jet buzzes a Polish aircraft over the Black Sea.A Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter plane buzzed a Polish Border Guard aircraft patrolling over the Black Sea, near Romanian air space, causing the Polish plane to lose altitude, Romanian officials said in a statement that was then confirmed by the E.U. border agency Frontex.The unarmed Polish border plane, which was taking part in an operation focused on migration, illegal fishing and other matters, landed safely after Friday\u2019s encounter, the latest example of aggressive behavior by Russian fighter pilots over the Black Sea. In March, a Russian fighter jet collided with an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance drone, forcing the American aircraft down into the Black Sea.In a statement, Romania\u2019s government said the Russian plane\u2019s \u201caggressive and dangerous maneuvers\u201d created turbulence that made it difficult for the Polish crew to control the plane. The Russian government did not comment on the encounter.Milana Mazaeva and Enjoli Liston contributed reporting.",

        "title": "How Two Men\u2019s Disparate Paths Crossed in a Killing on the F Train",
        "author": "Michael Wilson, Andy Newman",
        "content": "It was a Monday afternoon and a 30-year-old man was ranting on an F train headed through Manhattan. He was a regular on the subway, once a gifted Michael Jackson impersonator, but he was also troubled. City workers had tried to help him for years.Inside the same car was a 24-year-old Marine veteran. After the military, he had dropped out of college, posting online about feeling \u201ccompletely unfulfilled,\u201d and now he was looking for a bartending job in the city.The man behaving erratically, Jordan Neely, was homeless. He shouted to others on the train that he was hungry, that he didn\u2019t care about returning to jail, that he was ready to die, witnesses said.What exactly happened over the next several minutes is unclear, but eventually the veteran, Daniel J. Penny, placed Mr. Neely in a chokehold \u2014 one similar to what he would have been taught in basic training, but with a crucial difference \u2014 and took him to the floor in a minutes-long struggle that ended Mr. Neely\u2019s life and stirred outrage throughout the city.Their encounter, captured on video by another passenger, has once again revealed the deep fault lines in the ways New Yorkers, and Americans beyond, view race, homelessness, crime and how some people seem to be treated differently by the police. The veteran, Mr. Penny, who is white, was questioned by the police, but has not been charged with a crime for killing Mr. Neely, who was Black.Was this a citizen trying to stop someone from hurting others? Or an overreaction to a common New York encounter with a person with mental illness?As investigators examine the moments before Mr. Neely\u2019s death, friends and family told of the slain man\u2019s sunny and upbeat demeanor as he struggled after his mother\u2019s murder when he was a teenager. More recently, he seemed in the grip of serious mental illness and had occasional outbursts of violence.Less is known of Mr. Penny, who spent most of the last several years outside New York.On Friday, Mr. Penny\u2019s lawyers, Steven M. Raiser and Thomas A. Kenniff, released a statement. \u201cWhen Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived,\u201d it read. \u201cDaniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\u201dImageMr. Neely with his friend Moses Harper, another Michael Jackson impersonator. Friends and family recalled Mr. Neely\u2019s upbeat demeanor as he struggled after his mother\u2019s murder when he was a teenager.Credit...Moses HarperMr. Neely\u2019s childhood was abruptly derailed when he was 14. He lived with his mother, Christie Neely, and her boyfriend in an apartment in Bayonne, N.J. (Reached earlier this week, his father declined to comment.)In 2007, Ms. Neely disappeared. Her body was found stuffed in a suitcase in the Bronx.She had been strangled; her boyfriend was charged with murder.\u201cThe relationship had been crazy,\u201d Mr. Neely testified at the boyfriend\u2019s trial when he was 19. \u201cA fight every day.\u201d Mr. Neely attended Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, where classmates were aware of his loss. Perhaps to deflect from talking about the painful experience, he leaned into his childhood love of Michael Jackson, which by then had grown into a fine imitation.\u201cEveryone called him Michael Jackson,\u201d said Wilson Leon, 30, a classmate. \u201cThe Michael Jackson of Washington Irving.\u201d\u201cHe would be very passionate about dancing,\u201d Mr. Leon said, \u201cvery good behavior with the teachers.\u201dBut Mr. Neely dropped out, his family said this week. In later years, he turned up on social media, executing highly choreographed Jackson impersonations in the subways, dressed like the performer in his prime.ImageMr. Neely attended Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, but later dropped out. A friend said he behaved well in class, and was passionate about dancing.Credit...Ruby Washington/The New York TimesMr. Leon happened upon his old friend\u2019s performances \u2014 \u201csometimes 42nd Street, sometimes the L train,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would say hi to each other.\u201dBut Mr. Neely had others watching him, concerned for his safety.He was well known for years to the social work teams that reach out to homeless people on the subways, and had hundreds of encounters with them, according to an employee of the Bowery Residents\u2019 Committee, a nonprofit organization that does subway outreach for the city.Mr. Neely was on what outreach workers refer to as the \u201cTop 50\u201d list \u2014 a roster maintained by the city of the homeless people living on the street whom officials consider most urgently in need of assistance and treatment. He was taken to hospitals numerous times, both voluntarily and involuntarily, said the employee, who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss his history.Mr. Neely racked up more than three dozen arrests. Many were of the sort that people living on the street often accrue while homeless, like turnstile-jumping or trespassing. But at least four were on charges of punching people, two of them in the subway system.Outreach workers noted that Mr. Neely heavily used K2, the powerful, unpredictable synthetic marijuana. In June 2019, an outreach worker noticed that Mr. Neely had lost considerable weight and was sleeping upright. Around that time, he was reported to have banged on a booth agent\u2019s door and threatened to kill her, according to the worker\u2019s notes. Then he was gone.At some point, Mr. Neely became a client of an Intensive Mobile Treatment team \u2014 one of the squads of mental health clinicians who minister to people in streets and shelters. In March 2020, the team had Mr. Neely taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was kept for a week, according to homeless-outreach records. It was not clear what contact the team had with him after that.ImageMr. Neely had frequent encounters with hospitals and the criminal and mental health systems, and was on a city list of homeless people whom officials were most concerned about.Credit...Jonah Markowitz for The New York TimesIn November 2021, Mr. Neely\u2019s aggression seemed to peak, when he punched a 67-year-old woman in the street on the Lower East Side, the police said. The woman suffered severe facial injuries, including a broken nose, according to court documents. He was charged with assault and, awaiting the resolution of his case, spent 15 months in jail, the police said, though his family said the stint was shorter.He pleaded guilty on Feb. 9 of this year, in a carefully planned strategy between the city and his lawyers to allow him to get treatment and stay out of prison.\u201cDo you know what the goal is today?\u201d the judge, Ellen M. Biben, asked at the hearing.\u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Neely replied.\u201cWhat is that goal?\u201d\u201cTo make it physically and mentally to the program.\u201dHe was to go from court to live at a treatment facility in the Bronx, and stay clean for 15 months. In return, his felony conviction would be reduced. He promised to take his medication and to avoid drugs, and not to leave the facility without permission.\u201cThis is a wonderful opportunity to turn things around, and we\u2019re glad to give it to you,\u201d Mary Weisgerber, a prosecutor, said.\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Mr. Neely replied.But just 13 days later, he abandoned the facility. Judge Biben issued a warrant for his arrest.In March, an outreach worker saw him in the subway, neatly dressed, calm and subdued, and got him a ride to a shelter in the Bronx. (The outreach workers typically do not check for arrest warrants when interacting with homeless people.) But a downward spiral followed.On April 8, when outreach workers approached him in a subway car at the end of the line in Coney Island, Mr. Neely urinated in front of them. When an outreach worker went to call the police, according to a worker\u2019s notes, Mr. Neely shouted, \u201cJust wait until they get here, I got something for you, just wait and see.\u201dOfficers arrived and ejected Mr. Neely from the train, apparently unaware of the arrest warrant.The following week, an outreach worker saw him in Coney Island and noted that he was aggressive and incoherent. \u201cHe could be a harm to others or himself if left untreated,\u201d the worker wrote.Two weeks later, he was riding an F train in SoHo for what would be the last time.Less is known about Mr. Penny, six years out of high school, four of them spent in the Marines. He attended high school in West Islip, on the south shore of Long Island, and played lacrosse, the news site Gothamist reported. In the military, he received several ribbons and awards common in peacetime activity, according to his military records, and was promoted to sergeant before leaving active duty in 2021.ImageThe killing has become a flashpoint for the city, touching concerns about racism and treatment of homeless and mentally ill people but also fears about crime and safety on the subways in particular.Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York TimesA person named Danny Penny with an identical military background posted on Harri.com, a website for those seeking work in the hospitality industry, that he had tried college, \u201cfelt completely unfulfilled\u201d and \u201cdecided to drop out of school and backpack throughout Central America.\u201dHe worked for several months, until last May, at a surf shop in North Carolina near the Marine base where he was last stationed, Camp Lejeune.\u201cHe loves anything surfing related,\u201d said Sam Santaniello, 19, who worked at the shop with Mr. Penny. \u201cHe\u2019s a people person. He\u2019s a very easygoing person. Not a lot stresses him out.\u201dMr. Penny posted on the hospitality site that he dreamed of bartending in Manhattan.\u201cDuring the travels I rediscovered my love for interacting and connecting with people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBeing able to serve and connect with the most interesting and eccentric the world has to offer, is what I believe I am meant to do.\u201dMore details will emerge describing the moments leading up to the chokehold on the train. But one thing seems clear: The maneuver resembled one Mr. Penny almost certainly was taught in the Marines.\u201cThese choking techniques, if applied properly, are a fast and safe way to knock out the enemy,\u201d a sergeant said in an article on the Marines website.New Marines are trained to apply a \u201cblood choke,\u201d which, when done properly, cuts off blood and oxygen to the brain in as little as eight seconds. But it is imperative in a blood choke to not squeeze the person\u2019s windpipe, which could lead to injury or worse, according to training documents.On the F train on May 1, Juan Alberto Vazquez, a freelance journalist, began recording video after Mr. Penny had placed Mr. Neely in a headlock. He said later that Mr. Neely had been yelling about being hungry and unafraid to die, but it is unclear if he had physically threatened anyone. It is also unclear whether Mr. Neely and Mr. Penny interacted before the encounter, but Mr. Penny and the other riders on the train would not have known about Mr. Neely\u2019s history of arrests.Mr. Penny held Mr. Neely down. The restrained man thrashed and kicked for at least two minutes before becoming limp. Two men hovered over the action, helping to pin down Mr. Neely.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to catch a murder charge,\u201d another passenger can be heard saying on the video. \u201cYou got a hell of a chokehold, man.\u201dIt is unknown whether Mr. Penny was attempting the blood choke he had learned a few years earlier. The moment when Mr. Neely should have lost consciousness \u2014 after eight seconds or so \u2014 had long passed.One witness, Johnny Grima, said he entered the subway car while Mr. Penny was still choking Mr. Neely but after Mr. Neely had stopped moving. \u201cWhen they let him go, Jordan\u2019s eyes were open, staring out into space and he was limp,\u201d said Mr. Grima, 38, a formerly homeless man who lives in the Bronx and did not know Mr. Neely.In the video, as Mr. Penny lets go and stands up, Mr. Grima can be heard saying, \u201cDon\u2019t leave him on his back, though, man, he might choke on his own spit if you put him on his back \u2014 put him on his side.\u201dOne of the men who had been holding Mr. Neely down complies with the request, rolling Mr. Neely onto his side. While he does so, Mr. Penny fetches a baseball cap from under a subway seat, which he had apparently dropped in the struggle, and puts it back on.Six hundred miles away, Mr. Penny\u2019s surfing friend, Mr. Santaniello, watched the video like countless others. He could only guess at Mr. Penny\u2019s mind-set: \u201cKnowing Danny and knowing his intentions, it was to help others around him.\u201dSubway riders and transit workers called for help. Paramedics took Mr. Neely to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.ImageMr. Neely and Mr. Penny encountered each other on an F train on Monday. Mr. Neely was yelling. Mr. Penny wrapped his arms around his neck and pinned him down. Mr. Neely died soon after.Credit...Paul MartinkaJonah E.

        "author": "Amy Chozick",
        "content": "Elizabeth Holmes blends in with the other moms here, in a bucket hat and sunglasses, her newborn strapped to her chest and swathed in a Baby Yoda nursing blanket. We walk past a family of caged orangutans and talk about how Ms. Holmes is preparing to go to prison for one of the most notorious cases of corporate fraud in recent history.In case you\u2019re wondering, Ms. Holmes speaks in a soft, slightly low, but totally unremarkable voice, no hint of the throaty contralto she used while running her defunct blood-testing start-up Theranos.\u201cI made so many mistakes and there was so much I didn\u2019t know and understand, and I feel like when you do it wrong, it\u2019s like you really internalize it in a deep way,\u201d Ms. Holmes said as we stopped to look at a hissing anaconda.Billy Evans, Ms. Holmes\u2019s partner and the father of their two young children, pushes a stroller with the couple\u2019s 20-month-old son, William. William enjoys playing in the sand, \u201cThe Little Blue Truck,\u201d dumplings and, like his mom, already speaks some Mandarin. But William especially loves the San Diego Zoo, which is why, on a recent Thursday afternoon, I found myself in the surreal situation of trying to make sense of Ms. Holmes\u2019s version of her rise and fall, while watching a restless cheetah and buying a gorilla T-shirt at the gift shop.\u201cHow would you spend your time if you didn\u2019t know how much time you had left?\u201d Ms. Holmes said, her impending prison report date top of mind, perhaps even more so given that we were surrounded by animals behind bars. \u201cIt would be the kind of things we\u2019re doing now because they\u2019re perfect. Just being together.\u201dMs. Holmes has not spoken to the media since 2016, when her legal team advised she go quiet. And, as the adage goes, if you don\u2019t feed the press, we feed on you. In Elizabeth Holmes, we found an all-you-can-eat buffet. It had everything: The black turtlenecks, the Kabuki red lipstick, the green juices, the dancing to Lil Wayne. Somewhere along the way, Ms. Holmes says that the person (whoever that is) got lost. At one point, I tell her that I heard Jennifer Lawrence had pulled out of portraying her in a movie. She replied, almost reflectively, \u201cThey\u2019re not playing me. They\u2019re playing a character I created.\u201dSo, why did she create that public persona? \u201cI believed it would be how I would be good at business and taken seriously and not taken as a little girl or a girl who didn\u2019t have good technical ideas,\u201d said Ms. Holmes, who founded Theranos at 19. \u201cMaybe people picked up on that not being authentic, since it wasn\u2019t.\u201dMaybe?Ten years ago, Ms. Holmes was the world\u2019s youngest self-made female billionaire, worth $4.5 billion (on paper, in Theranos stock), and one of the most visible and celebrated female C.E.O.s on the planet, running a start-up with a $9 billion valuation. Then, in 2015, The Wall Street Journal published an investigation into Theranos, calling into question whether its labs and technology \u2014 a sleek, boxy device called the Edison \u2014 actually worked as promised, testing for a wide range of illnesses with a tiny amount of blood collected with a rapid finger prick.In 2016, federal inspectors from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found \u201cdeficient practices\u201d in a Theranos lab that posed \u201cimmediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.\u201dThat began a saga that would eventually lead to Ms. Holmes being convicted of criminal fraud charges.ImageMs. Holmes in an interview in 2015.Credit...David Orrell/NBCUniversal, via Getty ImagesThe 15-week trial began in 2021 and featured extensive testimony about troubling practices at Theranos. The jury heard from several patients, including one who said a Theranos blood test revealed she was having a miscarriage when, in fact, she had a healthy pregnancy. Ms. Holmes was not convicted on any counts related to patients. But the testimony was a stark reminder of the human stakes of choosing biotech as your start-up.Ms. Holmes was found guilty in January 2022 on four of 11 charges that she defrauded Theranos investors out of more than $100 million. Her top lieutenant at Theranos, and much older boyfriend at the time, Ramesh Balwani, was found guilty of 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud at Theranos. He began a 13-year prison sentence last month. On Thursday, his legal team filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit.During the closely followed proceedings, a prosecutor, Robert Leach, said this was a case \u201cabout fraud, about lying and cheating,\u201d alleging that Theranos raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors by misleading them about its blood-testing technology\u2019s capabilities.Lance Wade, a lawyer for Ms. Holmes, said that his client \u201cmade mistakes, but mistakes are not crimes.\u201dBy the time I met Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans, they were counting the days until April 27, when she had been required to report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, for 11.25 years. (Shortly before she was due at prison, Ms. Holmes made a last-minute request to remain free pending an appeal, which automatically delayed her report date by an undetermined amount of time.)Day 44: the afternoon we ordered in Mexican food at their quaint rental home near the Pacific.Day 43: the morning we went for breakfast and Ms. Holmes breastfed her baby, Invicta (Latin for \u201cinvincible\u201d) and sang along to Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cAll That She Wants\u201d on the loudspeakers (\u201cThis is the first album I ever owned.\u201d).Day 42: the time we had croissants and berries and Mr. Evans made coffee and we walked the couple\u2019s 150-pound Great Dane-mastiff mix, Teddy, on the beach.On the second day we spent together, Mr. Evans asked me what the most surprising part of spending so much time with Ms. Holmes was. I told him it\u2019s that I didn\u2019t expect her to be so \u2026 normal?If you didn\u2019t know she was that Elizabeth, whose trajectory launched a cottage industry of podcasts, TV shows, Halloween costumes and groupies who sold blonde wigs outside her trial, then you might sit next to her at the Lucha Libre taco shop in Mission Hills without thinking twice.This is when Billy puts on the deep voice. The guttural one that the world heard in Ms. Holmes\u2019s TED Talk and CNBC appearances and in the actress Amanda Seyfried\u2019s Emmy-award-winning turn as Ms. Holmes in Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Dropout.\u201dIf you hate Elizabeth Holmes, you probably think her feigned perma-hoarseness was part of an elaborate scheme to defraud investors. If you are a person who is sympathetic to Ms. Holmes, then the James Earl Jones inflection was a sign of the impossible gymnastics that female founders must perform to be taken seriously. If you spend time with Ms. Holmes, as I did, then you might come away like me, and think that, as with many things about Elizabeth Holmes, it was both. Either way, even Mr. Evans agrees, the voice was real weird.He was driving the family\u2019s Tesla. Ms. Holmes climbed in, after strapping the babies, calm and happy, into their carseats. I rode shotgun. \u201cThat would be crazy, if she answered the door and said, \u2018Hi. I\u2019m Elizabeth Holmes,\u201d Mr. Evans said, imitating the voice. Ms. Holmes let out the slightest of giggles from the back seat.***I realized that I was essentially writing a story about two different people. There was Elizabeth, celebrated in the media as a rock-star inventor whose brilliance dazzled illustrious rich men, and whose criminal trial captivated the world. Then there is \u201cLiz,\u201d (as Mr. Evans and her friends call her), the mom of two who, for the past year, has been volunteering for a rape crisis hotline. Who can\u2019t stomach R-rated movies and who rushed after me one afternoon with a paper towel to wipe a mix of sand and her dog\u2019s slobber off my shoe.After Ms. Holmes was convicted, Rupert Murdoch, who invested $125 million in Theranos, emailed The Wall Street Journal, a newspaper he owns, calling himself \u201cone of a bunch of old men taken in by a seemingly great young woman! Total embarrassment.\u201d I am not a smarter or more astute observer of human behavior than Mr. Murdoch or George Shultz, the former secretary of state who helped end the Cold War, or James Mattis, the retired four-star Marine Corps general and former defense secretary, both of whom were Theranos board members and investors. So, how could I be sure that \u201cLiz\u201d wasn\u2019t another character that Ms. Holmes had created?I was admittedly swept up in Liz as an authentic and sympathetic person. She\u2019s gentle and charismatic, in a quiet way. My editor laughed at me when I shared these impressions, telling me (and I quote), \u201cAmy Chozick, you got rolled!\u201d I vigorously disagreed! You don\u2019t know her like I do! But then, something very strange happened. I worked my way through a list of Ms. Holmes\u2019s friends, family and longtime supporters, whom she and Mr. Evans suggested I speak to. One of these friends said Ms. Holmes had genuine intentions at Theranos and didn\u2019t deserve a lengthy prison sentence. Then, this person requested anonymity to caution me not to believe everything Ms. Holmes says.This warning stuck with me, and it got at something that had been gnawing on me since I first met Ms. Holmes. How do you have an honest conversation with a person whose fraud trial has played out so publicly? I tried to ask Ms. Holmes this directly. How do I believe you when you\u2019ve been convicted of (basically) lying? But how could I ask someone who was nursing her 11-day-old baby on a white sofa two feet away if she was actually conning me?It was in these uncomfortable exchanges that Mr. Evans often stepped in. \u201cYour question is, \u2018How do you say anything when everything you say is going to be doubted?\u2019 You just have to say it,\u201d he said.So, to just say it: Ms. Holmes knows what you\u2019re thinking about her trial, and the birth of her two babies.ImageCredit...Philip Cheung for The New York TimesWhen she alerted the court on March 12, 2021, that she was pregnant with her first child, Mr. Leach, the prosecutor, called the news \u201cfrustrating.\u201d The trial had already been delayed because of the pandemic, and was pushed back a few more weeks, until after she gave birth that July.Which is why she was there in a San Jose federal courthouse using the high-tech Elvie breast pump with its glowing aqua nipples. \u201cShe looked like a Fembot,\u201d Mr. Evans said.At her sentencing hearing in November 2022, she was visibly pregnant with her second child. That baby was born in February. In March, Ms. Holmes\u2019s defense team partly cited her \u201ctwo very young children\u201d in arguing that she should remain free while appealing her fraud conviction. A Daily Mail headline referred to the baby as a \u201cLast-Ditch Bid for New Trial.\u201dBut, as Ms. Holmes explains it, it\u2019s just bad timing (to put it mildly). She is 39. She fell in love with Mr. Evans in 2017. They did not anticipate that she would be indicted. They did not anticipate that she would be sentenced to 11 years. They always wanted a big family.\u201cIf we let how other people might view that, or what impression someone might make of it dictate how we live our lives, then we\u2019ve lost,\u201d Ms. Holmes said. \u201cFinding your person in the middle of all of this and experiencing that love when you\u2019re going through hell is the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d***I\u2019d hardly sat down in Ms. Holmes\u2019s and Mr. Evans\u2019s home the first time we met in person, when Ms. Holmes told me about her work at the rape-crisis hotline. She\u2019d just finished a 12-hour shift, which she does a few times a week from home using her cellphone, answering calls when they come in.She then put this work into context, telling me how surviving a rape at a fraternity party her sophomore year at Stanford had, in retrospect, colored so many of her life choices. It\u2019s the part of her story that she keeps getting back to. The one she told a sympathetic, but ultimately undeterred jury, according to news reports. The one she wants people to (finally) listen to. (I later reviewed a 52-page Santa Clara police report that documented the details of the alleged sexual assault and Ms. Holmes\u2019s injuries. Ms. Holmes did not press charges.)Ms. Holmes hands the baby to Mr. Evans. \u201cI\u2019ll give her to you when we\u2019re talking about this stuff,\u201d she said. She continued, \u201cI woke up with this guy who was my friend having sex with me and I couldn\u2019t get him off of me.\u201d Ms. Holmes said the assault, in October 2003, contributed to her decision to drop out several months later and start a company.To help her do that, she turned to Mr. Balwani, known as Sunny, whom she first met in 2002 on a college trip to China. Ms. Holmes was 18. Mr. Balwani was 37 and had already successfully founded and sold a tech company.In March 2004, her sophomore year, Ms. Holmes left Stanford and moved in with Mr. Balwani to get Theranos off the ground. (Mr. Balwani guaranteed a loan to Theranos and joined the company in 2009.) \u201cI really thought I\u2019d be safe,\u201d Ms. Holmes said. \u201cMy friends at school and that whole universe, it didn\u2019t exist anymore when I was with him. It was all gone.\u201dAs Ms. Holmes explained it, echoing a key part of her defense strategy, Mr. Balwani kept close control over her every action. She detailed extensive domestic abuse and sexual assault. She said that Mr. Balwani forced her to stop speaking to her family and Stanford friends and pressured her to adopt the black-turtleneck, red-lipstick persona.\u201cHe always told me I needed to \u2018kill Elizabeth,\u2019 so I could become a good entrepreneur,\u201d she said.Jeffrey Coopersmith, a lawyer for Mr. Balwani, denied the allegations. \u201cOur client is not a person who is vindictive or mean spirited or aggressive,\u201d he said.She lived by entrepreneurial tenets that she said Mr. Balwani told her she needed to follow in order to succeed. These included not sleeping for more than five hours, going vegan, getting to the office daily by 5 a.m., no alcohol.\u201cIt was only when people started to raise questions about the company that I started to see that he was not who I thought he was in business,\u201d Ms. Holmes said of Mr. Balwani. \u201cAnd then that made me start to question everything else.\u201dImageThe device Theranos called \u201cEdison.\u201dCredit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesOne of the last times we spoke, I asked Ms. Holmes to clarify what she meant. As C.E.O., wasn\u2019t she in charge? She said Mr. Balwani did not control her every interaction or statement at Theranos, but she \u201cdeferred to him in the areas he oversaw because I believed he knew better than I did,\u201d and those areas included the problematic clinical lab.Mr. Balwani\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Coopersmith, said his client was in regular contact with Ms. Holmes about any issues at the lab, adding that she \u201cwas a strong woman who had a vision and Sunny was helping her execute her vision.\u201dMs. Holmes\u2019s story of how she got here \u2014 to the bright, cozy house and the supportive partner and the two babies \u2014 feels a lot like the story of someone who had finally broken out of a cult and been deprogrammed. After her relationship with Mr. Balwani ended and Theranos dissolved, Ms. Holmes said, \u201cI began my life again.\u201dBut then I remember that Ms. Holmes was running the cult.***In person, Ms. Holmes is engaging, but she is also somewhat socially stunted. It\u2019s as if Rip Van Winkle fell asleep in his early 20s in a start-up and woke up a 32-year-old at Burning Man. That\u2019s because in the 14 years Ms. Holmes led Theranos she didn\u2019t do any of the normal things 20-somethings do, according to her friends and family. Ms. Holmes had so few actual friends, she said, when she was running Theranos that she once pulled a female pharmaceutical executive aside to ask if the way Mr. Balwani treated her was normal in a relationship. However \u2014 the same person who warned me about Ms. Holmes pointed out that she seemed to have plenty of wealthy, famous friends in this period.In 2015, when The Wall Street Journal first reported on serious flaws in Theranos\u2019s technology, Debbie Sterling, an entrepreneur and classmate of Ms. Holmes\u2019s from Stanford, reached out asking if Ms. Holmes needed someone to talk to. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t have any friends. I only work, from the first thing in the morning until late at night,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sterling recalled. \u201cIt was kinda creepy.\u201d She corrects herself: \u201cNot creepy, but concerning.\u201d They eventually met for breakfast in Palo Alto.Ms. Sterling said she thought about her friend as two distinct people: There was \u201cblack turtleneck Elizabeth\u201d and there was \u201creal Elizabeth.\u201d Ms. Sterling, along with several other Stanford friends, attended the trial to support Ms. Holmes. But first she bought brown drugstore hair dye, worried that being seen there might impugn her reputation.In 2016, as regulators scrutinized Theranos, Mr. Balwani resigned. Theranos shut down its clinical laboratory and laid off roughly 40 percent of its estimated 790 employees. Ms. Holmes\u2019s brother (and Theranos executive), Christian Holmes V, helped her pack up and move out of the mansion she\u2019d shared with Mr. Balwani. Ms. Holmes, barred from working in a medical laboratory for two years, checked into a hotel and then rented a two-bedroom home in Los Altos. She had almost no belongings, so her parents sent her some \u201990s chintz furniture that they had in storage.ImageRamesh Balwani leaving court in San Jose after his fraud conviction last year.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesIn 2017, as Theranos faced an onslaught of legal challenges, both civil and criminal, Ms. Holmes moved to San Francisco, where she met a recent M.I.T. graduate and entrepreneur, Billy Evans, at a house party during Fleet Week to benefit wounded warriors. Mr. Evans had gone out to get ice for a party he was hosting at his own apartment and a friend texted to ask if he was going to the benefit. He agreed to swing by for a few minutes and never made it to back to his party.A mutual friend introduced him to Ms. Holmes and the pair talked for three hours. \u201cMy friends were texting, \u2018Where are you? We\u2019re here,\u201d Mr. Evans recalled. \u201cTo say we immediately fell in love isn\u2019t an overstatement.\u201dMr. Evans was 25 and living with roommates in San Francisco, but in many ways he was more mature than Ms. Holmes. She was 32 and had never opened a bottle of wine. \u201cElizabeth lived in complete isolation with Sunny,\u201d her father, Christian Holmes IV, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain the extent to which she missed so much of the growing up that someone does in their 20s.\u201d As Theranos settled an onslaught of civil lawsuits and federal prosecutors closed in on criminal charges, Ms. Holmes started to socialize again, reconnecting with family and friends. \u201cDespite everything going horribly in her life, we had our daughter back, and it was wonderful to see how she used to be,\u201d her mother, Noel Holmes, said.Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans quickly became more than friends and moved in together. \u201cIt had been two years of all this stuff written about me, and I think you get to know someone in a totally different way when you walk in with that skepticism versus if you meet when everything is sunshine and roses,\u201d Ms. Holmes said. \u201cThat allowed us to get to know each other in a really deep way.\u201dIn 2018, the Justice Department indicted Ms. Holmes, accusing her of lying when she told investors that Theranos\u2019s devices could quickly perform a full range of clinical blood tests using a finger prick, even though she knew the tests were unreliable, limited and slow.The much-hyped box didn\u2019t do much of anything. And most of the promises that put Ms. Holmes on the map turned out to be fiction.The Theranos board, failing to find a buyer for the start-up, eventually dissolved the company.Where do you go when your life\u2019s work and reputation go up in flames? \u2026 Burning Man.Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans went to the desert oasis for moneyed bohemians. She burned a tribute to Theranos. \u201cThere was an incredible sense of grief because I\u2019d given everything to it, my whole life, since I\u2019d been 18,\u201d she said of that period.The following year, in 2019, after U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila set a date for Ms. Holmes\u2019s criminal trial, she and Mr. Evans hit the road. As prosecutors assembled their case, Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans spent six months traveling the country in an R.V., sleeping in campgrounds and Walmart parking lots. Ms. Holmes balanced outdoor yoga and long hikes in national parks with working on her legal defense.I tell Ms. Holmes (in so many words) that it seems like she became blissfully happy just as her life was falling apart. She does not disagree. \u201cEven though that period was a crisis and Theranos was my life and like my child, I gave everything I had to it,\u201d she said. After it was gone, \u201cI also became free.\u201dAt least, for now.***Mr. Evans, whose parents are prominent hoteliers in San Diego, and Ms. Holmes have an us-against-the-world ethos that is both romantic and rings slightly of Bonnie and Clyde. They say they\u2019ve been chased out of residence after residence, no matter how remote. On my way to their front door, I walk past rows of orange storage containers filled with the couple\u2019s personal belongings. They never unpack, Mr. Evans explains, concerned they\u2019ll have to move again when they\u2019re found.The morning we went to the zoo, Mr. Evans stopped at Starbucks. He returned to find the barista had written \u201cBilly the Kid\u201d on his coffee cup. Ms. Holmes didn\u2019t get the reference.Mr. Evans took a few calls for work while I was visiting. I asked what he does. \u201cA lot of different stuff, investing, starting companies,\u201d he replied, without elaborating. How is Ms. Holmes paying her legal expenses? \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to work for the rest of my life to try to pay for it.\u201d I asked if Mr. Evans\u2019s family was helping to cover her legal expenses. She shook her head no.An earlier legal team quit after Ms. Holmes could not pay them. One pre-sentencing report by the government put her legal fees at more than $30 million. Ms. Holmes did not detail how those fees would be paid, and her current representatives at Williams & Connolly did not respond to emails asking about her financial arrangement.Their toddler, William, recently had a 105-degree fever, the couple said. They raced him to the emergency room. The first thing the attending doctor said was, \u201cYou look a lot like that horrible woman.\u201d Ms. Holmes looked at him with her piercing blue eyes, and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re a better person than she is.\u201d The doctor seemed to realize who he was talking to. She continued, \u201cThen he said, \u2018Are you Elizabeth Holmes?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and he said, \u2018I am so sorry,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t be, all you know is what you\u2019ve read.\u2019\u201dBy Billy\u2019s father, William L. Evans\u2019s tally, there are \u201cover 67,600,600\u201d web results on Ms. Holmes, all of them negative, compared with \u201c21 million results, many of which are positive\u201d for Osama bin Laden, figures he wrote in a letter to the court. Ms. Holmes\u2019s mother, Noel, said she stopped cold in a Barnes & Noble when she saw her daughter characterized in a book display as a \u201cparanoid sociopath\u201d who is \u201cdevoid of conscience.\u201d\u201cEverybody got on the train that Elizabeth was evil, and it was great copy, and they took it and ran with it,\u201d Ms. Holmes\u2019s father, Christian, said.Ms. Holmes\u2019s defenders, stretching back to childhood, said in letters to the court, and in conversations with me, that the feverish coverage of Ms. Holmes\u2019s downfall felt like a witch trial, less rooted in what actually happened at Theranos, and more of a message to ambitious women everywhere. Don\u2019t girl boss too close to the sun, or this could happen to you \u2026\u201cThere\u2019s an unspoken lesson for female executives: you\u2019re allowed to be successful but not too successful,\u201d Jackie Lamping, a Kappa Alpha Theta sorority sister of Ms. Holmes at Stanford, wrote in a letter to Judge Davila, who oversaw the trial.Ms. Holmes said she believed that making herself the poster girl for women in tech put a huge target on her back. She regrets being the subject of fawning magazine covers (though I imagine the authors of those stories regret it more). \u201cI never lost sight of the mission but I think I did of the narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cThe story became this story that was totally snowballed away from what we were actually talking about.\u201dOf course, Ms. Holmes also tried to control the story, often with scorched-earth tactics. She is typically docile, but got visibly upset when I asked about how the lawyer David Boies had threatened litigation against people who spoke negatively about Theranos. Alex Shultz, the father of the Theranos employees turned whistle-blower Tyler Shultz, and the son of George Shultz, told the court that Tyler \u201cslept with a knife under his pillow every night thinking that someone was going to come and murder him in the night.\u201d (Ms. Holmes and Mr. Boies parted ways and she replaced her legal team in 2016.)\u201cI\u2019m still thinking about the journalists being intimidated,\u201d Ms. Holmes said after we\u2019d moved on to several other topics. \u201cAs I said at trial, I completely wish we\u2019d handled that situation differently.\u201d She tears up. \u201cI take responsibility for it because I was C.E.O. of the company and at the end of the day, that\u2019s that, but I don\u2019t believe in people being treated that way, period.\u201d (In response to Ms. Holmes seemingly casting blame on her legal team, a spokeswoman for Mr. Boies texted, \u201cWhatever.\u201d)Ms. Holmes chooses her words carefully when I ask if the prominent men who invested and joined the Theranos board were drawn to the start-up partly because the founder was an attractive young woman. \u201cA lot of people were attracted to this for their own reasons,\u201d she said.What does she think would have happened if she hadn\u2019t garnered so much early attention as the second coming of Silicon Valley? Ms. Holmes does not blink: \u201cWe would\u2019ve seen through our vision.\u201d In other words, she thinks if she\u2019d spent more time quietly working on her inventions and less time on a stage promoting the company, she would have revolutionized health care by now.This kind of misguided talk is the one consistent thread in my reporting on who Ms. Holmes really is. She repeatedly says that Theranos wasn\u2019t a get-rich-quick scheme for her; she never sold her shares and didn\u2019t come out of it wealthy. Ms. Holmes\u2019s parents said they borrowed $500,000 against their Washington, D.C.-area home to post Ms. Holmes\u2019s bond.I can\u2019t shake an earlier story that Mr. Evans relayed. In the waning days of Theranos, Ms. Holmes got a dog, a Siberian husky named Balto. Last year, when a mountain lion carried Balto away from the front porch, Ms. Holmes spent 16 hours searching in the woods, digging through brambles and poison oak, hoping to find him alive. Everyone knew Balto was dead, but Ms. Holmes kept searching. The relentlessness. The certainty. The fanaticism. It\u2019s the same way Ms. Holmes kept hanging on at Theranos. ImageMs. Holmes arriving at federal court in San Jose, Calif., for sentencing in November.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesOver antioxidant smoothies, Ms. Holmes told me she has ideas for Covid testing, drawing on her work in a Singapore lab as a college student during the SARS outbreak.She maintains the idealistic delusion of a 19-year-old, never mind that she\u2019s 39 with a fraud conviction, telling me she is still working on health care-related inventions and would continue to do so behind bars.\u201cI still dream about being able to contribute in that space,\u201d Ms. Holmes said. \u201cI still feel the same calling to it as I always did and I still think the need is there.\u201dIf your head is exploding at how divorced from reality this sounds, that\u2019s kind of the point. When Ms. Holmes uses the messianic vernacular of tech, I get the sense that she truly believes that she could have \u2014 and, in fact, she still could \u2014 change the world, and she doesn\u2019t much care if we believe her or not. \u201cLiz is not a natural born leader; she is more of a zealot than a showman,\u201d Mr. Evans wrote to Judge Davila.It\u2019s this steadfast (or unhinged?) belief that has kept Ms. Holmes fighting, even though a guilty plea would have likely helped her chances of remaining free. \u201cShe could have said, \u2018Yes, I lied, and I tried my best to save mankind, but this happened in my enthusiasm,\u2019\u201d her father told me. \u201cBut she has taken the position that she is not guilty and that takes guts.\u201d Ms. Holmes eventually found her beloved husky, Balto, in the woods. But by then the dog was gone, torn apart by the mountain lion.***The last day I spent with Ms. Holmes, I parked and walked up the long driveway to find her and Mr. Evans embracing in the kitchen. They looked like they were slow dancing, swaying slightly, the two of them against the world. Fireplace burning. Seagulls flying overhead. Teddy drooling in his crate. Babies (plural) sleeping.Mr. Evans left for a workout, saying he doesn\u2019t want \u201cdad bod.\u201d Ms. Holmes and I sat at the kitchen table alone, talking. She didn\u2019t seem like a hero or a villain. She seemed, like most people, somewhere in between. As Ms. Holmes broke down thinking about what her children will be like in 11 years, I kept going back to her central promise at Theranos: The technology that she invented would, in her words, create \u201ca world in which no one ever has to say goodbye too soon.\u201dAnd there she was, preparing to do just that.That Friday, the couple were getting ready to host a group of friends from the Bay Area. They invited me to stay. They repeatedly invited me to come back, to bring my family. We could all go to the zoo together.I appreciated their hospitality, but I didn\u2019t fully understand it. Usually interview subjects can\u2019t wait to get rid of me.Then I realized why they kept opening the door wider. Ms. Holmes is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever met \u2014 modest but mesmerizing. If you are in her presence, it is impossible not to believe her, not to be taken with her and be taken in by her. Liz Holmes and Billy Evans know that. I politely declined their invitation.",

        "author": "Mark Landler",
        "content": "As milestones in British life go, the two could hardly have had less in common: Saturday\u2019s coronation of King Charles III, the grandest of all royal spectacles, and two days earlier, grass-roots elections for the mayors and other officials who are responsible for fixing potholes and picking up the trash.Yet each, in its own way, confirmed a Britain on the cusp of change.The stinging defeat of the Conservatives in elections on Thursday suggested that Britain\u2019s governing party could very well be swept from power in the general election that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak must call by January 2025. The crowning of Charles definitively turned the page from the 70-year reign of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and thrust the monarchy into an uncertain future.Three years after Britain left the European Union, and nine months after Britons grieved the death of the queen amid political and economic upheaval, the country is still groping for a post-Brexit identity. But even if its ultimate shape is not clear, Britain seems poised for a new era, both in politics and the monarchy.\u201cThe country is in a waiting room,\u201d said Simon Schama, the British historian and author of \u201cA History of Britain.\u201d \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s give our peculiar new king a chance,\u2019 while the prospect of an election pacifies a lot of the frustration and rage that people would otherwise feel.\u201dChange is not assured, of course. Charles, as a 74-year-old monarch, could prove to be a more cautious figure than his biographers expect. The coronation, with its medieval rituals \u2014 the king was anointed with holy oil from a silver spoon dating to 1349 \u2014 was nothing if not an exercise in continuity.ImageKeir Starmer, Britain\u2019s opposition leader, with supporters on Friday celebrating his Labour Party\u2019s successes in the previous day\u2019s English local elections.Credit...Gareth Fuller/Press Association, via Associated PressLikewise, the Conservatives, depleted as they are after the loss of more than 1,000 municipal seats, could yet cling to power. Their leaders pointed to polling estimates, extrapolated from the results of the local elections, that would still leave the opposition Labour Party relying on the support of smaller rivals to govern.But political scientists prefer to focus on longer-term trends, and those are running strongly against the Conservatives. The elections laid bare anger and impatience with a party that its critics say has left the country scandal-scarred, divided and facing lingering economic costs from Brexit after 13 years in power.Similar pressures are building on the monarchy, which has reigned over Britain a lot longer than that. Recent polls show that many Britons, particularly younger ones, view the royal family as irrelevant and question the need for it.\u201cThe royal family will have to think about the future,\u201d said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. \u201cLike other organs of the state and government, it is less trusted than it once was. You do have two currents of change pushing the same direction across the waterway.\u201d\u201cThe coming together of elections and the crowning of a monarch ought to lead to a moment of national introspection,\u201d Professor Travers added. \u201cOne hopes it won\u2019t devolve into a battle between boosters and declinists.\u201dAs the parties draw battle lines for a general election, there are signs that some of the cultural and social issues that have dominated Britain\u2019s political debate since before the Brexit vote in 2016 are finally fading.ImagePrime Minister Rishi Sunak hosting a lunch outside No. 10 Downing Street on Sunday to celebrate the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla.Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesWith the inflation rate in double digits and the economy on the edge of recession, the local elections were fought largely on economic matters, not on immigration, sovereignty or the promise to \u201cGet Brexit done,\u201d which propelled Boris Johnson, then the prime minister, to a landslide victory in the 2019 election.\u201cWe have passed peak Brexit,\u201d said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European studies at Oxford University. \u201cThe structural problems that flow from Brexit are still there, but it\u2019s the beginning of a long, slow, painful journey back.\u201dAmong the biggest questions is the future shape of Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union. This will shape the political debate, Professor Garton Ash said, but it will not be answered for several years, perhaps by the winner of the general election after next.Under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the government has taken steps to reset its relationship with the rest of Europe. Mr. Sunak eased tensions with President Emmanuel Macron of France, a guest at the coronation. Britain signed a deal to settle a trade dispute in Northern Ireland with the European Union, which sent three top leaders to the ceremony in Westminster Abbey.The king played a symbolic, if scrutinized, role in that deal by inviting one of those leaders \u2014 the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen \u2014 to Windsor Castle shortly after she and Mr. Sunak had signed the agreement.Critics said the king had been drawn improperly into politics, an impression heightened by the fact that Downing Street called the agreement the Windsor Framework. That suggested to some that he had put his imprimatur on it. Windsor is his family name, as well as that of the castle west of London where on Sunday evening Charles and his family celebrated the coronation with a star-studded concert.ImageThe Coronation Concert in Windsor, England, on Sunday.Credit...Pool photo by WpaKaty Perry, Lionel Richie and the English band Take That performed on a stage that framed the castle\u2019s eastern facade. The fashion designer Stella McCartney praised Charles for his work on climate change. Tom Cruise appeared in a video sequence, piloting a vintage warplane as he declared, \u201cYour Majesty, you can be my wingman any time.\u201dLights and lasers turned the castle into a backdrop for fluttering Union Jacks while a fleet of drones created the image of a twisting blue whale in the night sky.For all the razzle-dazzle, the concert felt slightly less starry than one held last year for Queen Elizabeth on her platinum jubilee. That captures the challenge Charles faces in succeeding his mother, a beloved figure who reigned longer than any sovereign in British history. Elton John, who dedicated an affectionate performance of \u201cYour Song\u201d to the 96-year-old queen, was conspicuously absent this time.\u201cShe was such an extraordinary figure that one could speak of a second Elizabethan age,\u201d Professor Garton Ash said. \u201cMost monarchs in the 21st century will not have ages named after them.\u201dStill, as an emissary for British values, he said Charles was \u201cturning out to be a good king.\u201d On his first foreign trip, to Germany, he won praise for his speech to the Parliament, in which he switched seamlessly from English and German, and delivered a robust expression of Western support for Ukraine.On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine congratulated Charles, and paid tribute to him, during a speech to the nation. Recalling a meeting he had with the king at Buckingham Palace in February, Mr. Zelensky said, \u201cI remember the sincere emotion for Ukraine and Ukrainians.\u201d He sent his wife, Olena Zelenska, and Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to represent him at the ceremony.The importance of the king\u2019s role in these moments should not be underestimated, political scientists said. At a time of domestic political and economic flux \u2014 of restive local elections and extravagant royal spectacles \u2014 the monarch is an enduring symbol of British identity and its place in the world.\u201cAll of that,\u201d Professor Garton Ash said, \u201cgives a country, which is not in very good shape or spirit, at least a bit of comfort.\u201dJeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from Dnipro, Ukraine.",

        "content": "Anointed with holy oil and enthroned on St. Edward\u2019s chair, King Charles III was crowned on Saturday in a solemn ritual that stretches back more than a millennium but unfolded with multiple concessions to the modern age.The coronation, the first since Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s in 1953, was a royal spectacle of the kind that only Britain still stages: four hours of pageantry that began with the clip-clop of horses\u2019 hooves on Pall Mall and ended with the vaporous trails of acrobatic jets streaking above Buckingham Palace, as Charles watched from the balcony with Queen Camilla, who had been crowned shortly after him.Yet this was a coronation for a radically\u00a0different country than when Elizabeth first wore the crown. Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Sikh leaders\u00a0greeted Charles as he left Westminster Abbey, and\u00a0there were various attempts \u2014 not always successful \u2014 to make a medieval ritual more inclusive and democratic.Female bishops from the Church of England took part in the liturgy; hymns were sung in Welsh, Scottish and Irish Gaelic; and\u00a0when Charles, 74, took a sacred oath to defend the Protestant faith, he also offered a personal prayer, in which he promised to be a pluralistic monarch for a diverse society.\u201cI come not to be served, but to serve,\u201d said Charles, moving gingerly in a velvet and gold lace robe first worn by his grandfather, George VI. \u201cGrant that I may be a blessing to all thy children, of every faith and belief.\u201dImageKing Charles leaving Westminster Abbey after his coronation.Credit...Pool photo by Gareth CattermoleAt the invitation of the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, who presided over the service, the congregation chanted, \u201cGod save King Charles,\u201d their voices echoing in the abbey\u2019s vaulted nave.Among those in the audience of 2,200 were heads of state, including President Emmanuel Macron of France; entertainment figures like the singer Lionel Richie; and the first lady of the United States, Jill Biden, though not President Biden, who posted his congratulations to Charles on Twitter from the White House.Outside, thousands of spectators lined the streets under a steady drizzle. There was little of the excitement that has electrified crowds after\u00a0royal weddings or the sadness that suffused mourners during the queen\u2019s funeral in September. But there was a collective sense of history in the making, and even a tingle or two as the newly crowned\u00a0king and queen passed in their gold state coach.History, of course, had been made already: Charles ascended to the throne upon the death of the queen. But the coronation sanctifies a monarch\u2019s rule and, through a national\u00a0celebration, aims to bind the sovereign to the people.If Elizabeth\u2019s coronation was one of the world\u2019s first mass-media events, its black-and-white images transmitted globally by the BBC, this was the first coronation of the digital age, shared by spectators on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook.\u201cI am just intrigued,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Boyce, 24, as she waited on a blanket in a park with a friend, Sarah Chappell, 23. Ms. Boyce insisted she was \u201cnot a big fan\u201d of the monarchy, but said, \u201cI think you can appreciate it without supporting it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a day in history isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ms. Chappell added.There were discordant notes. Hours before the service began, the police arrested the head of Britain\u2019s most prominent republican movement, Graham Smith, and others who had planned to protest in Trafalgar Square, along the procession route.Mr. Smith said this past week that the anti-monarchists would chant and brandish placards saying, \u201cNot My King,\u201d but would not disrupt the proceedings. Yet the police, armed with a much-disputed new law that allows them to crack down on demonstrations, rounded up Mr. Smith and others, well before Charles appeared.As word of the arrests spread, other protesters milled restively outside the cordoned-off area around Trafalgar Square.ImageGathering in the rain in St. James\u2019s Park in London to watch the coronation being streamed on giant television screens.Credit...Mary Turner for The New York Times\u201cI think it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said Charlie Willis, 20. \u201cTo have a giant party about having a crown put on your head when you have people dying of starvation and poverty. I mean would you do that?\u201dOne misstep in the days leading up to the ceremony was the archbishop\u2019s plan to \u201ccall upon\u201d millions of people across the United Kingdom and its realms to pay homage to the king, a modification that he framed as a democratizing step because that ritual had traditionally been reserved for the\u00a0aristocracy.But after a backlash, Archbishop Welby softened the wording. \u201cI now invite those who wish to offer their support do so, with a moment of private reflection, by joining in saying, \u2018God save King Charles,\u2019\u201d he said a touch tentatively.For many, however, the coronation was an excuse to cheer, wave Union Jacks and take part in the quintessentially English experience of getting wet together. \u201cCongratulations for braving the weather,\u201d said a voice from a loudspeaker near Buckingham Palace. \u201cMay the damp in our clothes not dampen our spirit.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rather festive, and the scene is very stoic of the British,\u201d said Rupert Birch, 56, an entrepreneur, who was sheltering from the downpour under one of the plane trees that line Hyde Park.Sarah Briscoe, 44, who works in financial services, credited the king with being ahead of his time on\u00a0issues like environmental sustainability. But she acknowledged the burden he had in succeeding Elizabeth, Britain\u2019s longest-serving monarch who became a revered figure and an anchor for the country.\u201cHis mother was so brilliant,\u201d Ms. Briscoe said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for him to live up to her, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe royal family\u2019s awkward dynamics were on display in the ceremony. Prince Harry, the king\u2019s estranged younger son, arrived alone with a gaggle of his cousins. Harry\u2019s wife, Meghan, stayed home in Montecito, Calif., with the couple\u2019s children, Lilibet and Archie, who celebrated his fourth birthday on Saturday.ImagePolice officers with demonstrators holding up anti-monarchy signs shortly before the procession began on the Mall on Saturday.Credit...Mary Turner for The New York TimesHarry was seated in the third row, between the husband of his cousin, Princess Eugenie, and Princess Alexandra, an 86-year-old cousin of the queen who is 56th in line to throne. He did not appear in the lineup on the palace\u00a0balcony, with British papers reporting that he was on his way back\u00a0to California by midafternoon.By contrast, Harry\u2019s brother, Prince William, his wife, Catherine, and their children played a conspicuous\u00a0role. Prince George, 9, their eldest son, held the king\u2019s robe as one of the pages. Their 8-year-old daughter, Princess Charlotte, beguiled onlookers in an ivory silk crepe dress by the designer Alexander McQueen \u2014 a\u00a0miniature version of the dress\u00a0worn by her mother.For Camilla, 75, now elevated from queen consort to queen, the coronation represented the end of a decades-long rehabilitation project that began with her marriage to Charles in 2005, after the messy dissolution of his marriage to Princess Diana.Among other prominent women\u00a0were Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, who stood, ramrod straight, bearing the\u00a0jewel-encrusted Sword of State during one of the longest parts of the service.She last won headlines in July\u00a02022 for unsuccessfully\u00a0challenging Rishi Sunak for the Conservative Party leadership. Mr. Sunak, Britain\u2019s first\u00a0Hindu\u00a0prime minister, played his own role by reading the first chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians.While most members of the royal family rode in carriages or cars during the grand procession back to the palace, Princess Anne, the king\u2019s younger sister, rode on horseback. An accomplished equestrian, she had the status of Gold Stick-in-Waiting, an honorary bodyguard to the sovereign.Even in a country used to royal spectacle, that parade beggared description: 19 military bands and 4,000 troops, stretching a full mile from the palace gates along the mall and around the corner into Whitehall.After saluting the troops in the garden behind the palace, Charles and his family appeared on the balcony to watch the aerial flyby, which was cut back by the low clouds. In place of the 60 aircraft originally planned, a flotilla of helicopters and Red Arrow acrobatic jets roared overhead.The day\u2019s enduring\u00a0focus, however, was on Charles. Somber throughout the two-hour ceremony, he\u00a0looked like a man feeling the weight of the crown \u2014 in his case, an imperial one set with 2,868 diamonds, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and 269 pearls. Only when he appeared on the balcony later did he flash a smile.ImageKing Charles III being escorted from Buckingham Palace on his way to Westminster Abbey.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesIn the ceremony\u2019s most intimate moment, Charles was anointed with holy oil, harvested from the Mount of Olives and consecrated in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. The archbishop conducted the ritual behind a screen \u2014 symbolizing the\u00a0privacy of what is intended as almost a divine encounter between the sovereign and God.Like other elements of the ceremony, the anointment dates to the coronation of King Edgar in A.D. 973 in the Roman city of Bath. That it has survived, unchanged, until the 21st century has intrigued historians.\u201cHow could a rite which had relevance to feudal England have any validity in the modern era?\u201d the historian Roy Strong wrote in his book, \u201cCoronation: A History of the British Monarchy.\u201d \u201cBut it did not only survive as some antiquarian aberration,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, it flourished.\u201dStill, the antique \u2014 some would say anachronistic \u2014 nature of the ceremony posed a challenge to the organizers, including the king, who has spoken of his determination to make the monarchy more forward-looking, relevant and inclusive.As part of his oath, Charles swore to uphold the Church of England, reaffirmed his Protestant faith and promised that all future monarchs would be Protestant. Seeking to put those words in a modern context, Archbishop Welby said the church sought\u00a0to \u201cfoster an environment in which people of all faiths and beliefs may\u00a0live freely.\u201dLater, in his sermon, the archbishop saluted Charles\u2019s commitment to charity and his lifetime of service to the people of his country. \u201cWe are here to crown a king,\u201d he said, \u201cand we crown a king to serve.\u201dMegan Specia, Emma Bubola and Saskia Solomon contributed reporting.",
