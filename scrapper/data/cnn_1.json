        "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story contains graphic descriptions of the shooting\u2019s aftermath.\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n      The man who opened fire Saturday at an outlet mall in Allen, Texas, killing eight people and wounding at least seven others was identified as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, the Texas Department of Public Safety said Sunday.\n  \n\n      Authorities have not yet zeroed in on a specific motive, but investigators uncovered an extensive social media presence by the gunman, including a possible link to right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n  \n\n      As the probe continues, another American community is left grieving in the aftermath of another mass shooting at a public place that once felt safe \u2014 from supermarkets, schools and Fourth of July parades. \n  \n\n      The massacre unfolded in the same week a gunman opened fire in a medical facility in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four others. And it came just weeks before Texas will mark a year since 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary school in Uvalde. \n\n\n      The gunman in Saturday\u2019s massacre was killed by an Allen Police Department officer who was at the mall on an unrelated call, police said. Investigators believe the shooter was acting alone.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourners have placed makeshift memorials at the mall.\n\nJeremy Lock/Reuters\n\n\n\n      Geoffrey Keaton was eating at the mall\u2019s Fatburger restaurant Saturday with his daughter when they heard gunshots approaching. They were rushed to a corridor and then outside, where Keaton said he saw people down on the sidewalk.\n  \n\n      \u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d he told CNN Sunday evening. \u201cIt was fast. It was definitely not anything that you expect or (are) prepared for because who prepares for a thing like that?\u201d\n  \n\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to go to the mall and lose your life,\u201d Keaton said.\n  \n\n      There have been 202 mass shootings across the US within the first five months of this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Both the nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n  \n\n      One of the victims in Saturday\u2019s massacre was identified by his family as Christian LaCour. \n  \n\n      \u201cChristian was a sweet, caring young man who was loved greatly by our family,\u201d his older sister Brianna Smith shared with CNN. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian LaCour\n\nBrianna Smith\n\n\n\n      At least nine people were rushed to trauma facilities, two of whom died, Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd said. \n  \n\n      As of Sunday afternoon, four of those patients were being treated at a local medical center, including three in critical condition and one in fair condition, Allen police said. One patient who was transferred to a Level I trauma center was in fair condition, police said. A patient transferred to a children\u2019s hospital was also in fair condition, while the ninth patient was also treated at a local hospital, police said. \n  \n\n    Investigators probe possible link to right-wing extremism\n\n\n      Authorities are investigating whether the gunman was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN.\n  \n\n      While authorities have not determined a specific motive, the source said the deceased suspect was found with an insignia on his clothing that read \u201cRWDS,\u201d which authorities believe may stand for \u201cRight Wing Death Squad.\u201d\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement arrive at an outlet mall in Allen, Texas, following reports of an active shooter.\n\nKTVT\n\n\n\n\n8 killed and 7 wounded in Texas mall shooting. The gunman is also dead\n\n\n\n\n      Some members of extremist groups have been seen in public in recent years with patches bearing the letters \u201cRWDS,\u201d according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors and reports on extremism.\n  \n\n      A photo obtained by CNN shows what appears to be the gunman lying on the ground after being shot, with an AR-15-style firearm nearby. He is clad in black body armor and appears to have several extra magazines strapped in his chest gear.\n  \n\n      In addition to the AR-15-style weapon found near him, Garcia had at least one other weapon on him when he was fatally shot in front of the mall, the senior law enforcement source said. Police also found multiple weapons in his car.\n  \n\n      Garcia underwent firearms proficiency training for his work as a commissioned security officer, according to the Texas Online Private Security database, which is maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. \n  \n\n\n    Read more\n  \n\nThis is how many mass shootings there have been so far this yearAnalysis: No end in sight for America\u2019s everywhere epidemicMass shootings have changed how these people live their lives\u2018Run, hide, fight\u2019 tactic in active shootings may be outdated\n\n\n\n\n\n      Garcia was approved to work as a security guard in Texas from April 2016 until April 2020, when his license expired, according to the database. His profile shows he worked for at least three security companies. None of those companies immediately responded to requests for comment. \n  \n\n      According to the database, Garcia received Level II and Level III security training. The former covers security laws in Texas; the latter, which is required for all commissioned security officers and personal protection officers in Texas, includes firearm training and the demonstration of firearm proficiency, according to Jonah Nathan, vice president of Ranger Guard, a security guard service in Texas not affiliated with Garcia\u2019s employers. \n  \n\n      In 2018, Garcia also completed a separate firearms proficiency training course that requires six hours of continuing education, according to the Texas DPS database. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacKenzie Bates (left), 17, of Allen, Texas, embraces her mother Rochelle on Sunday, the day after a mass shooting at Allen Premium Outlets in Texas.\n\nStewart F. House/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      Private security guards in Texas undergo background checks and are disqualified if they have committed certain crimes such as assault, burglary or sexual offenses, among others, according to the Texas DPS website and state codes. \n  \n\n      They are also disqualified if they have been dishonorably discharged from the US military; have been found incompetent by a court of law; or have been required to register as a sex offender.  It\u2019s unclear why Garcia\u2019s license expired.\n  \n\n      Garcia had been living in some form of transient lodging, according to the law enforcement source. The Dallas Morning News reported the suspect had been staying in an extended stay hotel in Dallas.\n  \n\n    \u2018One, two, three, five, six, seven bodies\u2019\n\n\n      Steven Spainhouer\u2019s son was working at Allen Premium Outlets when he received the phone call no father ever wants to hear.\n  \n\n      \u201cHe said, \u2018Dad, we have a shooting \u2026 I\u2019m pulling people into the break room, and we\u2019re going to lock the door,\u2019\u201d Spainhouer told CNN on Sunday.\n  \n\n      The former Army and police officer raced to the scene, called 911 and \u201cstarted counting the bodies on the ground \u2026 one, two, three, five, six, seven bodies.\u201d\n  \n\n      Spainhouer said he saw devastation unlike anything he had seen in the Army.\n  \n\n      \u201cI never imagined in 100 years I would be thrust into the position of being the first responder on the site to take care of people,\u201d Spainhouer told CNN affiliate KTVT.\n  \n\n      \u201cThe first girl I walked up to \u2026 I felt for a pulse, pulled her head to the side, and she had no face.\u201d\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteven Spainhouer, whose son worked at the mall, said the carnage defied imagination.\n\nKTVT\n\n\n\n      He said one child survived after his mother shielded him from the bullets. But the mother was struck and killed. \n  \n\n      \u201cWhen I rolled the mother over, he came out,\u201d Spainhouer told KTVT. \u201cHe was covered from head to toe, like somebody had poured blood on him.\u201d\n  \n\n      He said he performed CPR on three victims, but none of them could be saved. \n  \n\n      \u201cIt\u2019s unfathomable to see the carnage,\u201d Spainhouer said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough when you see a family that\u2019s out shopping, having fun, get wiped off the face of the earth.\u201d\n  \n\n    \u2018Someone\u2019s shooting\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Witness video from Saturday showed panicked shoppers in the parking lot of Allen Premium Outlets screaming and ducking behind rows of cars. Inside the sprawling complex, employees, shoppers and families with young children bolted and hid in storage areas or back hallways, witnesses told CNN.\n  \n\n      Witness Kingsley Ezeh said he was walking inside the mall when people behind him suddenly began running.\n  \n\n      \u201cI turned around and I saw two ladies rushing towards me, and then one was like \u2018Someone\u2019s shooting! Someone\u2019s shooting!\u2019\u201d he said.\n  \n\n      Behind the fleeing women, Ezeh said he could see a man holding his neck, which \u201cblood (was) just dripping down.\u201d\n  \n\n      Ezeh huddled with others in the back of a store for about an hour before police came to get them, he said. Other witnesses reported sheltering in place for up to two hours as police cleared the scene.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShoppers raise their hands as they leave the Allen Premium Outlets after the mass shooting Saturday.\n\nLM Otero/AP\n\n\n\n      Kimberly Blakey and her 14-year-old daughter were among the crowd trying to flee the parking lot during the attack. \n  \n\n      \u201cThe shooting happened over and over and over again. It was nonstop,\u201d she said. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: Wooden crosses are placed at a memorial dedicated to the victims of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School on June 3, 2022 in Uvalde, Texas. 19 students and two teachers were killed on May 24 after an 18-year-old gunman opened fire inside the school.

In the background, the Choir of Westminster Abbey sang the anthemic \u201cZadok the Priest\u201d by George Frideric Handel, which was composed for the coronation of King George II in 1727 and performed at every British coronation since.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing Charles III sits as he receives The St Edward's Crown during the coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey, London, Saturday, May 6, 2023. (Jonathan Brady/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nJonathan Brady/Pool/AP\n\n\n\n      Once he re-emerged, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St. Edward\u2019s Crown upon Charles III\u2019s head. It was the only time Charles will ever wear St. Edward\u2019s Crown, which is reserved for the coronation of a new monarch; the crown was made for the new King\u2019s namesake, Charles II, in 1661.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissed it? Here's King Charles' coronation in 3 minutes\n\n\n                            03:19\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n      After crowning Charles, Welby shouted: \u201cGod Save the King.\u201d Those in attendance repeated the words.\n  \n\n      Soon after, Camilla was also crowned. Like her husband, she was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury \u2013 this time in full view of the audience \u2013 before having Queen Mary\u2019s Crown placed on her head.\n  \n\n    A musical celebration\n\n\n      Music underpinned the entire celebration, in keeping with history. Each stage was marked by either a grand choral work, an ethereal motet, an extravagant organ composition or an evocative melody, all performed by some of the most accomplished singers and musicians in the world.\n  \n\n      King Charles and Queen Camilla entered the abbey to the strains of \u201cI was glad,\u201d the stirring coronation anthem written by Hubert Parry for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 and sung at all coronations since then.\n  \n\n      But the old was blended with the new; Charles had asked Andrew Lloyd Webber \u2013 whose music is more familiar to audiences in the West End than congregations in Westminster Abbey \u2013 to write a Coronation Anthem, \u201cMake a Joyful Noise,\u201d which played after Camilla was enthroned.\n  \n\n      And this event featured the first ever appearance by a gospel choir at a coronation; dressed in resplendent white, the Ascension Choir performed \u2018Alleluia\u2019 just before the Archbishop\u2019s sermon.\n  \n\n    Lady in blue \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenny Mordaunt leads King Charles III during his coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey.\n\nYui Mok/Pool/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      Thousands of people had packed into Westminster Abbey.\n  \n\n      Decked in a teal cape and cap with gold detailing, a woman in blue commanded attention as she wielded an important object of the coronation regalia \u2013 the Sword of Offering or the Jewelled Sword, before and after the investiture, when it was used. But who is she? \n  \n\n      Penny Mordaunt is a Conservative lawmaker in the United Kingdom, and has been since 2010. \n  \n\n      She was involved in the ceremony because, as the current Leader of the House of Commons, she is also the Lord President of the Privy Council \u2013 a body formed of senior politicians who act as the monarch\u2019s official advisers.\n  \n\n      The council\u2019s president is involved in a variety of royal ceremonies, acting as a symbolic bridge between the King or Queen and the country\u2019s elected officials. Mordaunt spoke at the Proclamation of King Charles, two days after the Queen\u2019s death.\n\n\n    Queen Camilla\u2019s outfit\n\n\nQueen Camilla was a regal sight in ivory, silver and gold. But who was she wearing? \n  \n\n      Unsurprisingly, it was a British designer, Bruce Oldfield, who she has a longstanding relationship with. \n  \n\n      Simple, tailored and cut from Peau de Soie, a silk fabric with a dull luster finish, her coronation dress was more akin to a coat dress with an embroidered underskirt as opposed to a traditional dress. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQueen Camilla and King Charles III arrive for their coronation at Westminster Abbey.\n\nAndrew Matthews/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      Arriving at Westminster Abbey before the service, her dress was protected by the crimson velvet and ermine Robe of State that was originally made for Queen Elizabeth\u2019s coronation. \n  \n\n      Peeping out beneath her dress were shoes in the same silk as her clothing, made by British designer Elliot Zed.\n  \n\n    Vanishing prince(s)\n\n\n      Never one to disappoint at royal events, Prince Louis, the youngest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, again stole the show during segments of the coronation ceremony.\n  \n\n      Keen-eyed viewers may have noticed the 5-year-old yawning, sitting between his mother, the Princess of Wales, and sister Princess Charlotte, but then pulling a disappearing act from the service. \n  \n\n      It was thought the young royal might leave early, but luckily for fans, he returned before the end of the service. \n  \n\n      For those who don\u2019t remember, Louis gained global infamy during the late Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June, where he was captured throwing a tantrum and covering his ears while screaming during the flypast.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince Louis yawns during the coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey.\n\nAndrew Matthews/Pool/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      Meanwhile, there was widespread speculation before Saturday as to whether Prince Harry would be at his father\u2019s coronation. \n  \n\n      The Duke of Sussex attended the coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey on Saturday, sitting in the third row.\n  \n\n      Wearing a morning suit with his military medals, Harry arrived alongside his uncles, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, and two of his cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.\n  \n\n      Prince Harry attended without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, who reportedly stayed back in the US with their children on the account of Archie\u2019s fourth birthday. \n  \n\n      The coronation marked the first time the prince publicly met members of his family since the release of his memoir, \u201cSpare.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Duke of Sussex with Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey.\n\nAndrew Matthews/PA/AP\n\n\n\n      After it ended, he was seen talking and smiling with his cousins amidst a downpour, before he took a car on his own. \n  \n\n      He did not appear with members of the royal family to greet the public from the balcony of Buckingham Palace on Saturday afternoon \u2013 a flagship part of royal events.\n  \n\n      CNN understands that Prince Harry did not receive an invitation to join the family for this balcony moment, which featured a slimmed-down flypast by the Royal Air Force. Prince Andrew wasn\u2019t present either.\n  \n\n    A balcony flypast\n\n\n      The weather did not favor King Charles \u2013 and while crowds seemed unperturbed by the rain, it did alter plans for the traditional Royal Air Force flypast.\n  \n\n      The display was formed only of helicopters and the colorful Red Arrows, and not the expected Typhoons, Spitfires, Hurricanes and Lancaster bombers.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Arrows fly over the watching crowds.\n\nYara Nardi/Pool/Reuters\n\n\n\n      But crowds instead enjoyed not one but two appearances on the balcony by the new King and Queen, who provided an encore after seemingly waving goodbye to supporters.\n  \n\n      That wrapped up an eventful day, which had drawn thousands onto London\u2019s streets.",

Her self-proclaimed \u201cobsession\u201d with curbing migration \u2013 and the loaded and occasionally inflammatory language she uses to address it \u2013 has attracted forceful criticism from international agencies, lawyers, rights groups and many of her own colleagues, making her arguably Britain\u2019s most divisive politician. \n  \n\n      But among Conservative Party members and the chief architects of Brexit, she is a star; someone who is prepared to say and do controversial things in pursuit of a singular goal. \n  \n\n      \u201cShe\u2019s the cutting edge of the populist, radical right-wing strain in the Conservative Party,\u201d Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London, and the author of books on the party, told CNN.\n  \n\n      \u201cIn a way, that allows her to say what some Conservative MPs would think of as the unsayable.\u201d\n  \n\n      Braverman has railed against what she calls an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants, holding \u201cvalues which are at odds with our country\u201d \u2013 and suggested she would break international law to deport them from Britain.\n  \n\n      And she is an equally furious culture warrior, borrowing rhetoric from the American right when lambasting \u201cwoke\u201d culture, transgender rights and climate protesters.\n  \n\n      \u201cShe\u2019s recognized that in the current political climate, her way of creating an impact\u2026 (is) positioning herself as a Trump tribute act,\u201d migration policy expert and campaigner Zoe Gardner told CNN.  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBraverman's profile was elevated amid a year of political chaos in 2022.\n\nLeon Neal/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      But Braverman has speedily made herself a central figure in British politics; the assassin of Liz Truss\u2019s premiership and the kingmaker of Rishi Sunak\u2019s, she has made evident her desire to ultimately enter Downing Street as prime minister herself \u2013 a prospect that sits uneasily with much of the country\u2019s political establishment.\n  \n\n    A \u2018cruel and dangerous\u2019 migration agenda\n\n\n      Braverman, who evangelizes on the benefits of Brexit and has made migration curbs her political mission, has a backstory that seems to teem with contradictions.\n  \n\n      She is the daughter of migrants, who wants to cut net migration to Britain to the \u201ctens of thousands.\u201d Her parents, both of Indian origin, arrived in the country from Kenya and Mauritius \u201cwith very little\u201d in the 1960s.\n  \n\n      She was a practicing lawyer before entering politics, but has displayed an unabashed indifference about whether her flagship migration bill complies with international law.\n\n\n      And she is an avid Francophile, sometimes speaking in French when meeting her counterpart in Paris, who championed the project to leave the European Union. Braverman says she fell in love with France while studying at the renowned Sorbonne university in Paris, taking advantage of the EU\u2019s Erasmus program that encourages students to spend time in other parts of the continent. Brexit shut the program off to British students. \n  \n\n      Now, she has staked her political reputation on her ability to \u201cStop the Boats\u201d \u2013 an oft-repeated government pledge, borrowed from Australia\u2019s hardline rhetoric towards asylum-seekers, to reduce the growing number of migrants crossing the English Channel on small vessels.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of small boat crossings to the UK has increased in recent years, with many asylum-seekers ending up in limbo in Britain.\n\nSameer Al-Doumy/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      It is a stance that has drawn sharp criticism \u2013 including from within the traditional wing of Braverman\u2019s Conservative Party.\n  \n\n      \u201cBraverman has placed far too much emphasis on curbing migration,\u201d said Ben Ramanauskas, an economist and adviser to Truss when the previous prime minister was secretary of state for international trade. \u201cHer priority seems to be attempting to be as cruel as possible.\u201d\n  \n\n      The government\u2019s flagship bill, which was approved by MPs last week but faces scrutiny in the House of Lords, essentially hands the government the right to deport anyone arriving illegally in the United Kingdom. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly dangerous, hostile, cruel, and fundamentally unworkable,\u201d Gardner  said. \n  \n\n      And experts say it deliberately misses the point. \u201cDeterrents don\u2019t work\u2026 There is absolutely no correlation whatsoever between how brutally we respond to migration, and the numbers of people forced to move,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWe need a functioning asylum system where we process people\u2019s claims, (and) we need to give people safe routes in order to travel.\u201d\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of RAF Wethersfield in Essex, as Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick is expected to announce the use of two RAF sites as he tries to reduce the \u00a36.8 million a day the Government says it spends on hotel accommodation.

The Home Office told CNN in a statement that her bill \u201cwill break the business model of the people smuggling gangs and restore fairness to our asylum system. It will ensure anyone arriving via small boat or other dangerous and illegal means will be in scope for detention and swiftly removed.\u201d \n  \n\n      Braverman\u2019s plans have won praise from Europe\u2019s leading populist figures, including Italy\u2019s hardline deputy leader Matteo Salvini and French far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.\n  \n\n      But that is company many in the Conservatives feel uncomfortable keeping. \n  \n\n      \u201cThe UK\u2019s ability to play a role internationally is based on our reputation \u2013 not because we\u2019re British, but because of what we stand for and what we do,\u201d ex-Prime Minister Theresa May said in a stinging intervention in the House of Commons last month. May added last week that the bill\u2019s removal of modern slavery protections \u201cwill consign victims to remaining in slavery.\u201d\n  \n\n      And Sayeeda Warsi, the first Asian chair of the Tory party, has attacked what she described as Braverman\u2019s \u201cracist rhetoric,\u201d after Braverman prompted controversy by singling out British Pakistani men when attacking grooming gangs in the country. \n  \n\n      \u201cBraverman\u2019s own ethnic origin has shielded her from criticism for too long,\u201d Warsi wrote in The Guardian. \u201cBlack and brown people can be racist too.\u201d The Home Office told CNN that Braverman \u201chas been clear that all despicable child abusers must be brought to justice. And she will not shy away from telling hard truths, particularly when it comes to the grooming of young women and girls in Britain\u2019s towns who have been failed by authorities over decades.\u201d\n  \n\n    War on the \u2018wokerati\u2019\n\n\n      Braverman fronts a newer, more populist streak in the UK\u2019s ruling party \u2013 a move that has troubled some of its grandees but has found an audience among voters.\n  \n\n      \u201cThe voters that she\u2019s appealing to is the majority of the British public,\u201d said James Johnson, who ran polling in May\u2019s Downing Street operation and later founded the JL Partners pollster. \u201cThere is a very significant disconnect between what people on Twitter about immigration, and what people actually think about immigration.\n  \n\n      \u201cVoters do not react to (Braverman\u2019s) language with the same outrage that some people do,\u201d he told CNN. \u201c(They) want their politicians to at least be trying.\u201d\n  \n\n      Polling shows that approval of Braverman\u2019s tough stance on migration significantly outpaces support for the government in general \u2013 as well as approval of Braverman herself \u2013 with research often indicating that a slim majority of the public supports her plans.\n  \n\n      And those who support her \u2013 particularly those in Euroskeptic circles, where she is almost revered \u2013 say Braverman speaks to the concerns of modern Britain in a way that her more seasoned critics cannot. \u201cWhen finally even I wobbled about backing Brexit in name only, Suella stood firm,\u201d prominent Brexit backer Steve Baker said when he supported her leadership campaign last year, praising Braverman\u2019s resolve to defeat May\u2019s Brexit deal and push for a harder-line departure from the EU. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened without her.\u201d\n  \n\n      But research has also shown that the importance of immigration to British voters has receded since the bitter debates of the mid-2010s. \n  \n\n      It appears inevitable that the Tories will seek to make migration a wedge issue at the next election, ensuring Braverman plenty of airtime as the government looks to draw a contrast between itself and the Labour party. But a series of brutal electoral results in local polls on Thursday will further fuel questions about whether that is a winning strategy.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBraverman resigned from Liz Truss's cabinet for breaking ministerial rules by using a private email address, but returned under Sunak just days later.\n\nJUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      Braverman\u2019s political coming-of-age took place just as the 2016 EU referendum shifted the tectonic plates underneath Westminster, giving younger, Euroskeptic voices like hers an inroad with the public.\n  \n\n      It was Braverman\u2019s role fronting an anti-EU backbench committee that \u201cpropelled her to her (current) position, and she knows it,\u201d former Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach told CNN. \n  \n\n      Today, she takes the populist mantle further than many of her peers on a range of matters far beyond Brexit. Braverman appears to relish \u201cculture war\u201d confrontations with her political enemies like few other frontline politicians; \u201cyou almost feel sometimes that she gets a kick out of \u2018owning the libs,\u2019\u201d the politics professor Bale told CNN. \n  \n\n      She has taken aim at the \u201cGuardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati\u201d from the despatch box, and insisted she will \u201cnot be hectored by out-of-touch lefties.\u201d In 2019, she said she considers herself engaged in a \u201cbattle against cultural Marxism.\u201d \n  \n\n      Braverman\u2019s Home Office recently reportedly backed two pub landlords who refused to remove their minstrel-style children\u2019s toys that are considered a racist relic of the 1970s. And she has criticized police officers for \u201cvirtue signaling,\u201d saying in a speech last week that \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be taking the knee.\u201d\n  \n\n      But those battles have left some traditional Tories cold. \u201cThe Conservative Party has moved right since I joined, and become much more like the MAGA Republicans\u201d since the dividing line of 2016, said Sandbach, who was expelled from the party by Boris Johnson after trying to avert a no-deal Brexit. She subsequently joined the Liberal Democrats. \n  \n\n    Leadership ambitions\n\n\n      Those who worked alongside Braverman describe her as friendly and personable, and few doubt her ambition. \n  \n\n      As 23-year-old Suella Fernandes, she nearly ran against her own mother to become the Tory candidate in a 2003 by-election, until the elder Fernandes \u2013 a Conservative councilor and NHS nurse \u2013 persuaded her to pull out. \n  \n\n      Braverman succeeded in becoming an MP in 2015. In a series of tweets that bemoaned her \u201clamentable hopelessness,\u201d one of her more critical backbenchers, William Wragg, claimed she asked in her first week in Parliament whether she could expense a fine for speeding. \n  \n\n      But her determination to drive towards power has served her well. No politician emerged more triumphant from the psychodrama that has transfixed British politics than Braverman, who started 2022 as attorney general and ended it a household name \u2013 having served in three different Cabinets, twice as home secretary.\n  \n\n      An initial departure from frontline politics theoretically came amid scandal (Braverman resigned for breaching ministerial rules by using a private email address), but her scathing parting letter turned her misconduct into a maneuver, essentially pulling the plug on Truss\u2019s shambolic tenure. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigel Farage hosts a primetime show on GB News, a British TV channel launched in June 2021 with the promise to challenge the 'woke worldview'\n\nStuart Mitchell/SOPA/Zuma/Alamy\n\n\n\n\nThe 'anti-woke' crusade has come to Europe. Its effects could be chilling\n\n\n\n\n      \u201cI have made a mistake; I accept responsibility: I resign,\u201d Braverman wrote, in a thinly veiled attempt to contrast herself with Truss. Six days later she was back in the same post, having aligned herself with Sunak\u2019s successful leadership bid.\n  \n\n      Few doubt Braverman\u2019s long-term ambitions. \u201cYou have to interpret everything Suella Braverman does and says in the light of the leadership contest that many people assume will take place if\u2026 Sunak were to lose the next election,\u201d Bale said.\n  \n\n      Crucial to that target is her reputation among party members and its more hardline MPs. It is those groups that pick a party leader, and she is met enthusiastically by grassroots Conservatives who tend to reflect the more right-wing, populist traits of the bloc.\n  \n\n      That prospect undoubtedly perturbs some. \u201cThere will be many Tory MPs who simply could not stomach her as leader,\u201d Bale added. \u201cI think the lack of support she received in her leadership bid (last year) reflects how she was seen by the party as a whole,\u201d Sandbach said.\n  \n\n      Nevertheless, Braverman is storming up the approval rankings among ordinary Conservative members. In its latest monthly league table of Cabinet ministers, the ConservativeHome website \u2013 widely regarded as having its finger on the pulse of the grassroots party \u2013 puts Braverman fourth from the top with a net approval rating of 47.8. Only last November, she was sixth from bottom in the site\u2019s regular survey of party members. \u201cThe panel seems to have decided that if the Government fails to stop the boats it won\u2019t be for want of the Home Secretary trying,\u201d wrote the website\u2019s editors in April.\n  \n\n      Should Braverman succeed at her next bid for the party leadership, her critics fear another rightwards shift in British politics. \n  \n\n      \u201cBraverman has taken some cues from the US, and also from history,\u201d Gardner said. \n  \n\n      \u201cShe\u2019s setting herself up to lead a more extreme, right-wing populist version of the Tory party.\u201d",

Loud boos and jeering from the crowd could be heard, as well as chants of \u201cLiverpool.\u201d\n  \n\n      Afterwards, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told reporters that he respected it was \u201ca big day for England\u201d but added: \u201cIt was clear that something like (the booing) would happen.\n  \n\n      \u201cThat\u2019s allowed, nothing else happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t any kind of chants or anything. People just showed \u2026 they were not always happy in the past with how the people of Liverpool, the city or the club, were dealt with.\u201d\n  \n\n      Liverpool fans have a history of booing the national anthem, most recently doing so before last season\u2019s FA Cup final at Wembley. Many also booed Prince William when he appeared on the pitch that day. \n  \n\n      The club confirmed it would play \u201cGod Save the King\u201d ahead of its match against Brentford on Saturday to respect the coronation of King Charles III, despite admitting that many supporters hold \u201cstrong views\u201d on the issue. \n  \n\n      The decision came after the Premier League requested that the national anthem be played ahead of every match this weekend to celebrate the coronation services of the King and the Queen Consort, which took place on Saturday. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Liverpool fan holds up a sign saying 'Not My King.'\n\nMike Egerton/PA Images/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      \u201cBefore kick-off and in recognition of the Premier League\u2019s request to mark the coronation, players and officials will congregate around the centre circle when the national anthem will be played,\u201d Liverpool said in a statement Friday.  \n  \n\n      \u201cIt is, of course, a personal choice how those at Anfield on Saturday mark this occasion and we know some supporters have strong views on it.\u201d \n  \n\n    Why fans boo?\n\n\n      So why exactly do Liverpool fans have a history of booing the British national anthem? The answer has everything to do with the history of the city itself. \n  \n\n      Liverpool suffered during the deindustrialization of the UK economy in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, resulted in nine days of riots in the city.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool v Nottingham Forest - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - April 22, 2023\nNottingham Forest fans hold up a banner in memory of the 97 victims of the Hillsborough disaster REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nPhil Noble/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nTragedy chanting: 'Vile' soccer songs about deaths fueled by 'need to hurt' opposing fans\n\n\n\n\n      In the aftermath of the unrest, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government talked of a \u201cmanaged decline\u201d of the city.\n  \n\n      During this decade of Conservative rule, Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of the country, and the state\u2019s handling of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 further entrenched those anti-establishment feelings.\n  \n\n      Booing of the national anthem at football matches when the team played at Wembley \u2013 which was frequent given Liverpool\u2019s dominance of English football in this era \u2013 became widespread and remains so today. \n  \n\n      Many fans had the same reaction at the Carabao Cup final in February 2022 and at the FA Cup final in 2012. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool fans have a history of booing the national anthem. \n\nAdam Davy/Press Association/AP\n\n\n\n      Booing the anthem is a way for some of the club\u2019s supporters to voice their opposition towards the establishment, and it\u2019s a chance to do so before a worldwide audience. \n  \n\n      The King\u2019s coronation on Saturday also comes at a time when many are feeling the devastating effects of the severe cost of living crisis that is now impacting the whole of the UK.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiz Coopey, left, a volunteer at the Given Freely Freely Given food bank in Doncaster, helps local resident Angela Davis with her shopping bags.\n\nIvana Kottasova/CNN\n\n\n\n\n'It's not a good look.'

        "content": "CNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n      Think of Italy and you\u2019re likely to think of food first and all the beautiful places to see second.\n  \n\n      Italian cuisine \u2013 or some version of it \u2013 has colonized the rest of the world so successfully that there are probably uncharted corners of the Amazon rainforest where you can sit down at a red-and-white checkered tablecloth and order up a plate of pasta and sauce.\n  \n\n      There\u2019s a reason the food is so good. Actually, there are hundreds of reasons scattered throughout the different regions of Italy. If you can\u2019t get to them all, here are some top classics:\n  \n\n    Pizza Napoletana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Searching for Italy' bonus: Stanley Tucci makes a pizza\n\n\n                            01:29\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n      Italy\u2019s gift to TV box set bingers, deadline busters and delivery scooter manufacturers needs no introduction. Pizzas can be summoned to almost anywhere on the planet \u2013 including an intercity train \u2013 within 30 minutes provided there\u2019s a phone connection and worthwhile tip.\n  \n\n      But that greasy slice you\u2019re eating out of a box (for breakfast? Seriously?) is a far cry from the real thing. A true Italian pizza is thick, tender and has an elasticity when chewed. It\u2019s traditionally dressed with fresh tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, basil leaves and melting mozzarella or fior di latte cheese \u2013 or simply plain white pizza. The most savory is buffalo milk mozzarella.\n  \n\n      Many atrocities have been committed in the name of pizza science \u2013 hot dog-stuffed crust anyone? Or pineapple pizza? But the original still never tastes better than in Naples, the city of its birth.\n  \n\n    Tagliatelle al rag\u00f9\n\n\n      The rest of the world calls it \u201cspaghetti bolognese.\u201d But the rest of the world is wrong. This perfect blend of delicate rag\u00f9 sauce and fresh golden tagliatelle pasta is a signature of the northern Emilia Romagna region, in particular the city of Bologna. Hence the global name.\n  \n\n      Legend has it the tagliatelle shape was inspired by the curly blond hair of fearsome 16th-century Italian noblewoman Lucrezia Borgia. The rag\u00f9 is made with finely chopped or ground pieces of pork and beef mixed with celery, carrots, onions, tomato sauce and red wine.\n  \n\n      Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is grated on top, like a snow-capped peak. The original ancient recipe is protected by the Azdore, \u201cpasta priestesses\u201d who prepare fresh tagliatelle for clients each day across the region at fresh pasta boutiques.\n  \n\n    Rigatoni alla carbonara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh rigatoni alla carbonara with egg, parmesan cheese, pork cheek, olive oil and black pepper.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Few ingredients go into making this dish, but the secret is in their quality and the way they stick to the tube shaped pasta. Pecorino cheese, pork cheek and raw organic eggs are all that\u2019s needed for Rome\u2019s specialty dish.\n  \n\n      Being a heavy and protein-rich meal, it\u2019s usually served at dinner. The homemade rigatoni, must be \u201cal dente\u201d \u2013 cooked to exactly the point when it\u2019s neither soft nor hard\u2013 so the dense egg-rich dressing clings without leaking into the plate. Spaghetti can also be used, preferably the homemade type with a gritty surface.\n  \n\n      Carbonara may owe its creation to American influence \u2013 it\u2019s likely that pasta with egg and bacon flourished with the arrival of the American troops in Italy during World War II \u2013 but Romans, and Italians in general, like to stick to an indigenous tale according to which the dish was a favorite of charcoal burners working on the cold Apennine Mountains.\n  \n\n\n\nCasu marzu: The world's 'most dangerous' cheese\n\n\n\n\n    Trofie al pesto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrofie al pesto is delicious with a rich, creamy sauce.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      The word pesto literally means \u201ccrush\u201d in Genoese. In this case, basil, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, pine kernels, garlic cloves, coarse salt and extra virgin olive oil, pulverized together in a Genoese marble mortar. They combine to create a dense, creamy sauce that smells of a Mediterranean garden and cries out to be stirred through a bowl of handmade trofie pasta twists.\n  \n\n      This dish is at its best in Genoa, in northwestern Liguria, a land of seafarers and adventurers. The region was a spice trade hub in the Middle Ages, when use of herbs and flowers to flavor food became commonplace. \n  \n\n      A legacy of these times, pesto flourished in the 1800s based on an earlier, older recipe made with garlic called \u201cagliata.\u201d\n  \n\n    Lasagne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRich layers of lasagne satisfy the soul.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Freezer-ready superstore versions of this classic \u2013 more suited to propping open doors or breaking windows \u2013 have done it few favors over the years. But if made well with rich layers of rag\u00f9, b\u00e9chamel sauce and Parmigiano cheese oozing between hand-made \u201csfoglia\u201d sheets of fresh flat pasta, it\u2019s still heavenly.\n  \n\n      Eaten via recipes that use either spinach or tomatoes, lasagne is closely linked to the northern city of modern Bologna, but it traces its origins to Roman times.\n  \n\n      It was, reputedly, philosopher Cicero\u2019s favorite because its refinement and softness was easier to digest than many others found his outspoken beliefs. He\u2019s said to have gulped down huge quantities up until he was killed.\n  \n\n    Brodetto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish brodetto, the Italian version of France's bouillabaisse, features a brothy mix of seafood.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Solo diners should avoid ordering this dish, unless they\u2019re: A) really hungry. B) massively into fish. Brodetto is a fish soup of gigantic proportions. It\u2019s served as a single main course but usually takes two people to finish.\n  \n\n      Ray, mullet, sole, redfish and prawns gaze up from the bubbling pot, swimming in a pool alongside semi-ripe tomatoes, parsley and garlic. Grilled bread slices are dropped in before the eating starts and left to absorb the fishy liquid.\n  \n\n      Once all the fish is gone, it\u2019s time to devour the soaked bread. At the very end, thin spaghetti, called capelli d\u2019angelo (or angel hair), is thrown inside the pot and mixed with the remaining sea broth.\n  \n\n      It\u2019s a topsy-turvy meal typical of Vasto on the Adriatic coast.\n  \n\n    Tortellini\n\n\n      Handmade pasta shaped like knots are stuffed with pork loin, ham, Mortadella salami, Parmigiano cheese, eggs and nutmeg and thrown in a thick capon broth.\n  \n\n      Spurious legend has it that a voyeuristic innkeeper in Bologna was peeking through a keyhole to spy on Venus, Mars and Bacchus in the middle of a hot and heavy threesome. He caught just a glimpse of the goddess\u2019 perfect belly button and tried to reproduce it in pasta form.\n  \n\n      Voila! Tortellino was born.\n  \n\n      The original recipe is protected by the Confraternity of Tortellino, die-hard purists who don\u2019t tolerate creative twists.\n  \n\n      Many towns in the Emilia Romagna region claim to be the originators of this staple dish, but there\u2019s staunch rivalry between three: Modena, Bologna and Castelfranco Emilia, a small town halfway between them.\n  \n\n    Gelato\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelato is a warm evening classic in Italy.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Yes, we know that \u201cgenuine\u201d gelato places have opened in your neighborhood. And we know it\u2019s good.\n  \n\n      But it\u2019s still not as good as the stuff you can eat anywhere in Italy, with warm evening sun on your face and an orchestra of ancient Vespas revving in the background.\n  \n\n      Gelato is said to have been inspired by ancient Sicilians, who mixed fruit juice with snow from Mount Etna. Today, recipes call for milk, cream, sugar and eggs.\n  \n\n      Traditional local flavors include pistachios, toasted almonds, nuts, lemons, mandarin oranges, figs and cactus figs.\n  \n\n      It can be savored on its own or together with a brioche bun as the Sicilians do. Bun pieces are used to scoop the gelato, which can also be spread inside like a peanut butter sandwich.\n  \n\n\n\n50 of the world's best desserts\n\n\n\n\n    Baccal\u00e0 alla Vicentina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaccal\u00e0 alla Vicentina is made with dry fish. But approach this with an open mind -- and mouth.\n\ncourtesy Confraternita Baccaia\n\n\n\n      This dish is made from dried fish.\n  \n\n      No, stay with us! This isn\u2019t the gelatinous reconstituted fish of Scandinavian nightmares. This is a far more delicious proposition.\n  \n\n      The secret is in the preparation \u2013 a recipe invented by merchants from Vicenza in the 1500s and protected by a brotherhood of chefs. Dried cod is softened by beating and then placed under running water for two days. Then extra virgin olive oil, milk, Parmigiano, onions and anchovies are added and cooked slowly so that the ingredients penetrate into each other.\n  \n\n      It\u2019s said that while savoring it, your mouth should feel the living fish still swimming in the ocean, a scenario which, we admit, is slightly nightmarish.\n  \n\n    Polenta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolenta's neutral flavor makes it a great mix with many other foods.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      This dish of boiled cornmeal mush is best served as a steaming semi-liquid on a wooden platter. It can also be cooled, solidified, chopped into fingers and served grilled as rectangular finger foods.\n  \n\n      Once a peasant dish believed to have aphrodisiac powers, it\u2019s a great gluten-free substitute for bread. Having a neutral flavor, it\u2019s good with everything: rabbit, mushrooms, braised veal with tomato sauce and milk. Even Nutella.\n  \n\n    Carciofo alla giudia\n\n\n      This fried, crispy golden globe artichoke, which makes a crunchy sound with each bite, is a delicacy of Rome\u2019s Jewish quarter.\n  \n\n      The criteria for selection is strict. Only the best variety are chosen. They\u2019re 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) wide, twice the normal size, and grow on the uppermost part of the plant that\u2019s absorbed the most sunlight.\n  \n\n      Once the rough leaves are delicately trimmed with a cobbler\u2019s knife, the artichoke is dipped twice in frying oil at different temperatures. Served as an appetizer, sometimes upside down with the stem in the air, overspilling the plate like a blooming flower.\n  \n\n    Risotto alla Milanese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaffron gives Risotto alla Milanese its golden glow.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      It\u2019s an Italian staple with an exotic taste. This creamy rice dish gets its golden color and soft texture from saffron. That\u2019s why it\u2019s also called risotto allo zafferano, although the Milanese call it by the more prosaic name, risotto giallo.\n  \n\n      Local carnaroli or arborio rice is cooked with veal broth, butter, Grana Padano cheese and sometimes bone marrow. The secret to making a great risotto alla Milanese lies in giving the rice time to absorb the flavors.\n  \n\n      As always, there\u2019s a backstory. This one centers on a Dutch artist who, at a posh dinner while he was on assignment decorating the windows of Milan\u2019s Duomo cathedral, served up a rice dish including the saffron he was using as a yellow dye. It proved an instant hit.\n  \n\n    Porceddu\n\n\n      Don\u2019t freak out if on your tour of Sardinia you come across village food fairs where baby piglets are staked and cooked over a bonfire. It\u2019s all perfectly normal around these parts, and if you like meat and you\u2019re not squeamish, we\u2019re sorry to report that crunchy piglet is delicious.\n  \n\n      Porceddu (meaning piglet in Sardinian) is a dish of baby pig that has fed solely on its mother\u2019s milk and weighs less than 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds). That ensures the meat is tender and has a less pungent taste.\n  \n\n      Once killed, it\u2019s roasted for hours in public squares and prepared in a variety of ways. While cooking, drops of liquid lard are poured over the piglet to make it crunchier and tastier. When ready to be served, it can be glazed with honey and sprinkled with herbs.\n  \n\n      Preparing it is a spectacle, and the secret to making a great crunchy porceddu lies in skillful rotation of the gigantic skewer so that the outer skin is crispy but not burned while the meat remains tender.\n  \n\n\n\nThe tragedy behind Italy's famous pasta dish\n\n\n\n\n    Bombolotti all\u2019Amatriciana\n\n\n      Amatriciana sauce was born in the town of Amatrice, a town in Italy\u2019s central Lazio region, when a local recipe was adapted after tomatoes were brought here following the discovery of America.\n  \n\n      Since adopted as a Rome classic, its secret lies in choosing the right kind of pasta \u2013 and none does it better than bombolotti.\n  \n\n      These thick, wide macaroni have ridges that trap the sauce made from premium tomatoes, fried crispy pork cheek and a topping of grated savory Roman pecorino cheese. True to its name, the bombolotti explodes deliciously in the mouth at first bite.\n  \n\n    Caponata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll ask for more vegetables when they're in caponata.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Sweet-tasting veggies are not something typically ordered in Italy, but this extravagant Sicilian concoction will win anyone over. It\u2019s a sweet and sour mix of different vegetables dressed in a sauce of tomato extract, onions, celery, capers and olives.\n  \n\n      There are many caponata variations, but most use small potatoes, eggplant and bell peppers cooked with almonds, pine nuts, raisins, sugar, vinegar, extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil.\n  \n\n    Tiramis\u00f9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Completely different': Tucci samples traditional tiramisu\n\n\n                            01:50\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n      It\u2019s no shock that a country famous for its desserts and famous for its coffee would find a way to combine them so sublimely. What is a shock is that this glorious combination was supposedly conjured up in a brothel.\n  \n\n      Tiramis\u00f9 is concocted of layers of Savoiardi ladyfinger biscuits dipped one by one in a whipped mixture of mascarpone cream cheese and a fine blend of different coffee powders. Chocolate powder is also sometimes added, but purists like to stick to just coffee.\n  \n\n      It\u2019s traditionally made in large trays and served in rectangular portions like lasagne.\n  \n\n      The name tiramis\u00f9 literally means \u201clift me up\u201d or \u201cpull me up\u201d \u2013 a reference to the restorative powers it apparently bestowed upon customers of brothels in the northern city of Treviso, allowing them to spend more money.\n  \n\n    Insalata Caprese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsalata Caprese is a celebration of fresh simplicity.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Can\u2019t cook but want to learn to prepare great Italian food? Start here. This symbol of the Mediterranean diet is made simply by alternating slices of fresh tomatoes and mozzarella cheese dressed with extra virgin oil, salt, pepper and fresh basil leaves.\n  \n\n      The white of the mozzarella juxtaposed with the red of the tomato and the green of the basil is said to represent the Italian flag. Its birthplace is believed to be the chic island of Capri. Insalata Caprese means \u201csalad made the Capri-way.\u201d \n  \n\n    Bollito alla Piemontese\n\n\n      Meat addicts will love this dish originating from the northern region of Piedmont. Bollito simply means \u201cthe boil\u201d and is a feast of various meats. One single dish holds boiled pieces of seven different beef cuts plus parts of other animals: calf\u2019s head, chuck steak, ox tongue, ox tail, flank; one whole capon and one cotechino pork sausage.\n  \n\n      Carrots, onions, fresh rosemary, celery, garlic, salt and pepper are added to spice up this butcher\u2019s platter. The meat can then be dipped in a variety of bittersweet sauces.\n  \n\n      The trick is all in the timing and temperature. The longer the meats are boiled, the tastier they get, but there\u2019s a risk of destroying the flavor through overboiling.\n  \n\n    Linguine allo scoglio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis linguine dish showcases fresh catch from the sea.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Meaning \u201csea rock\u201d in Italian, scoglio is a name that suits this dish of linguine entwined with calamari, clams, mussels, shrimp and baby prawns and dressed with chili pepper, parsley, tomatoes and a glug of white wine.\n  \n\n      It\u2019s a seafood pasta recipe hailing back to the ancient fishing traditions when families living along the coast ate their evening pasta with the fresh daily catch.\n  \n\n      Linguine, aka \u201csmall tongues,\u201d is a flat thin noodle ideal for seafood dishes. This dish resembles shoreline rocks after crashing waves have left behind a handful of marine life. The original recipe comes from Naples but has extended to most southern cities. In Rome, it\u2019s also served wrapped in tinfoil.\n  \n\n    Parmigiana\n\n\n      Not to be tackled for lunch unless there\u2019s room for an afternoon nap, this tasty dish is an oozing stratification of fried eggplant slices, Pachino tomato sauce, eggs, fresh basil and caciocavallo or fior di latte cheese.\n  \n\n      The best eggplants are the oval, dark purple, fat ones ideal for frying. They can also be topped with grated, smoked ricotta.\n  \n\n      Despite the name, it has nothing to do with northern town of Parma but comes from deepest Sicily and is a popular dish mainly in southern Italy.\n  \n\n\n\n25 delicious Italian dishes you might not know\n\n\n\n\n    Coda alla vaccinara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best versions of this dish take two days to cook.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      This dish is what happens when you let oxtail stew for hours in a huge pan of celery, carrots, onions and a liter of red wine. The best versions take two days, with ingredients simmered slowly over a low flame until the meat falls away from the bone at the touch of a tongue.\n  \n\n      At the end of the meal, grilled bruschetta slices are often dipped in the pan to mop up the remaining carrots, oxtail and celery sauce. This typical Roman dish, usually savored during festivities, is so tender it melts in the mouth.\n  \n\n    Vitello tonnato\n\n\n      Italians don\u2019t usually like to mix meat and fish, but there are a few exceptions. One is vitello tonnato, aka veal covered in tuna cream.\n  \n\n      This unusual concoction sees boiled veal fillets sliced into circles and covered in a dense layer of mayonnaise mixed with shredded tuna, anchovies and capers. The concoction is typically served cold as an appetizer.\n  \n\n      It\u2019s a specialty of the Piedmont region, which bears the influence of past French conquerors.\n  \n\n    Malloreddus alla Campidanese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalloreddus alla Campidanese is a tasty gift from the Italian island of Sardinia.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Malloreddus are tiny, shell-shaped, durum-wheat flour pasta that are served with a sauce of onions, sausage rag\u00f9 (preferably flavored with fennel) or dried salami and dressed with salty Sardinian pecorino cheese. Basil can also be added.\n  \n\n      The sauce gets trapped inside the malloreddus\u2019 tiny pockets. Local lore has it that the name of the pasta in regional dialect means \u201clittle bulls\u201d as their shape reminded shepherds of calves. It\u2019s a classic main course from Sardinia\u2019s southwest Campidano area.\n  \n\n    Tonnarelli cacio e pepe\n\n\n      Tasty Roman pecorino cheese, blended with sprinkled black pepper, melts as soon as it mixes with the thick, curly tonnarelli spaghetti freshly pulled out of a pot of boiling water.\n  \n\n      The secret to making a great sauce is adding teaspoons of hot salty water from the boiling pasta pot to help the ingredients blend in a creamy, slightly adhesive sauce that sticks easily to the tonnarello.\n  \n\n      Cheese fanatics tend to add an extra layer of grated pecorino to make it even tastier. It\u2019s a simple Rome signature dish, found at typical trattoria.\n  \n\n    Sfogliatella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweet ricotta cheese fills these tasty pastries.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Those with a sweet tooth will adore this top Neapolitan pastry, which is fun to eat. There are two types of sfogliatella. The riccia, meaning \u201ccurly,\u201d is shaped like a shell and has crunchy layers of puff pastry stuffed with fresh sweet ricotta cheese, crushed candied orange bits, vanilla and cinnamon. It\u2019s sprinkled with sugar.\n  \n\n      When its corner is bitten off, the pastry unravels like woolen yarn exposing the inner filling.\n  \n\n      Ffrolla sfogliatella is roundish and stuffed with the same ingredients but wrapped in shortcrust pastry.\n  \n\n      Local poets have written sonnets praising the delicious taste of these \u201ctwo sisters.\u201d It\u2019s a street food sweet treat. In Naples, pastry stands sell sfogliatelle freshly made each day.\n  \n\n    Culurgiones\n\n\n      These handmade ravioli are stuffed with mashed potatoes, chopped mint, garlic and grated Sardinian pecorino cheese. They\u2019re best savored straight, \u201cin white\u201d with no added sauce but just a bit of extra virgin olive oil or grated tuna eggs (bottarga). They\u2019re laid out on the plate to form a blossoming flower.\n  \n\n      Culurgiones are also eaten with tomato sauce and fresh basil. Hand-shaping them can be tricky; it takes time to learn how to properly do it.\n  \n\n      Once the ingredients are wrapped inside the dough, the borders are pinched together to form little lines resembling wheat spikes. A typical dish from Sardinia\u2019s Ogliastra region, in the past it was prepared as a festive treat to celebrate grain harvest, a sort of local Thanksgiving food.\n  \n\n    Agnolotti del plin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgnolotti del plin comes from the Piedmont region of Italy.\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Hand-made squared ravioli with zig-zag edges filled with roasted meat, these are usually eaten either with veal broth, a rich meat sauce or with butter and sage.\n  \n\n      Being a highly nutritious dish, it\u2019s usually served at dinner and on special occasions. While the agnolotti are cooking, a glass of red wine can be poured over them to enhance the flavor. A thin layer of grated Parmigiano cheese is added at the end as topping. Plin is the final \u201cpinch\u201d given to close an agnolotto.\n  \n\n      In the past, farming families ate them without any sauce to best savor the Piedmont recipe\u2019s ingredients.\n  \n\n    Risotto al gorgonzola\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mixture of beer, coffee and ... cheese? This Michelin-Star dish is served in a can\n\n\n                            00:57\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n      This succulent rice dish was born on the border between Lombardy and Piedmont. Gorgonzola blue cheese is an ideal dressing for risotto. It has a delicate taste when added to locally grown rice varieties such as carnaroli that absorb the flavors during cooking.\n  \n\n      To make it, rice is cooked with vegetable broth with morsels of Gorgonzola thrown in at the end, just before butter and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese are added. Black pepper is sprinkled on top.\n  \n\n      Nuts and pieces of special sausages from the Piedmont town of Bra made with a mix of veal and pig fat can also be added to the dish.\n  \n\n      Gorgonzola cheese was, apparently, created by mistake. It\u2019s said that a young dairy man, eager to meet his girlfriend, forgot to finish his work and left the cheese pot outside. Instead of throwing away the almost rotten curd the next morning, he added a fresh layer. In between the two, green \u201cparsley\u201d looking veins of mold formed.\n  \n\n    Timballo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimballo is Italy's answer to: \"What should I do with the leftovers?\"\n\nShutterstock\n\n\n\n      Timballo is the art of recycling food leftovers from the day before or after a festive meal. It\u2019s the Italian equivalent of the Anglo-Saxon pie. Anything can go inside to stuff the shortcrust pastry as long as it\u2019s been previously cooked.\n  \n\n      Pasta, meat, cheese, vegetables, tortellini, eggs, sausages and even fish are mixed together with besciamella sauce and placed inside the dough, which is then folded and cooked in an oven.\n  \n\n      It\u2019s mostly eaten in central and northern Italy, with family recipes passed down through generations. Timballo was invented as a way to conserve expensive ingredients and make meals last for days.\n  \n\n  This article was first published in February 2021 and last updated in May 2023.",

He declared that his men would leave Bakhmut by May 10 because of inadequate supplies, resulting in heavy losses.\n  \n\n      But a new audio message posted Sunday on Telegram suggests he has changed his mind after concessions from the Russian government.\n  \n\n      \u201cThe bottom line is the following: they promise to give us ammunition and weapons, as much as we need to continue further actions. They swear to us that everything that is necessary will be on the flank so the enemy \u0441an\u2019t cut us off. We are told that we can act in Bakhmut as we see fit,\u201d Prigozhin said.\n  \n\n      The Russian Ministry of Defense did not immediately comment on Prigozhin\u2019s latest claim.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrigozhin now plans to keep his troops in Bakhmut after securing greater government support.\n\nYulia Morozova/Reuters\n\n\n\n      Bakhmut has been the site of a months-long assault by Russian forces that has driven thousands from their homes and left the area devastated. But, despite the vast amounts of manpower and resources Russia has poured into capturing Bakhmut, they have not been able to take total control of the city.\n  \n\n      \u201cWe\u2019ve taken 95% of Bakhmut. For this last 5%, the \u2018Red Army\u2019 [the Russian Armed Forces] are not playing any role,\u201d Prigozhin said in a message posted on his official Telegram channel Saturday.\n  \n\n      Prigozhin\u2019s blunt and brutal tactics in Bakhmut have long been likened to a \u201cmeat grinder.\u201d But, in his repeated threats to withdraw from Bakhmut, Prigozhin claimed this approach was no longer viable.\n  \n\n      \u201cThere will be no more meat grinder because there\u2019s nothing left to grind the meat with,\u201d Prigozhin said.\n  \n\n      The Wagner boss had said Wagner positions in and around Bakhmut would be transferred to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s forces from May 10.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFighting has raged in Bakhmut for months, but the city has not yet fallen to Russian troops.\n\nAnatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      But Prigozhin\u2019s latest message posted Sunday revealed that Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense had pledged significant support to the Wagner group, including allowing general Sergey Surovikin, the former overall commander of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, to help organize Wagner\u2019s operations.\n  \n\n      \u201cThey give us Surovikin as a person who will make all decisions in the framework of the military operations of PMC Wagner and interact with the Ministry of Defense,\u201d Prigozhin said.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAKHMUT, UKRAINE - DECEMBER 3: A park avenue damaged due to hostilities on December 3, 2022 in Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine.

Everyone unequivocally answered \u2018No.\u2019\u201d",
